The rate at which new bitcoins are created is algorithmically cut in half roughly every 4 years (210,000 blocks). Bitcoin has gone through three halvings to date; November 2012, July 2016 and most recently in May 2020. Since blocks are generated every 10 minutes on average and starting at 50 new bitcoins per block when the system was launched in 2009, this creates a very well-defined supply curve. 

The stability of Bitcoin's monetary policy
Bitcoin's monetary policy is disinflationary. The annual rate of inflation decreases through time. The current supply cap of Bitcoin is set at 21 million coins. The stability of Bitcoin's monetary policy provided by this well-defined supply cap and halving schedule is a key differentiator versus other crypto assets.

Mining
Miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks using a <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/sha-256"">SHA-256</a> algorithm. In this process, miners compete to generate a <a href=""https://messari.io/blog/hash-function"">hash</a> less than the target number set by Bitcoin's <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level"">difficulty adjustment algorithm</a>. The target difficulty level is adjusted every 2016 blocks.

Although open to anyone with a CPU, Bitcoin mining is now dominated by <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics"">ASICs</a> situated in enterprise-scale data centers. In order to smooth individual miner revenue as mining has become more competitive, mining is now done in pools where participants contribute <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/hash-power"">hash power</a> to the pool and receive a proportional share of the profits if the pool finds a valid block.

State of Cryptocurrency Mining",Proof-of-Work,Nakamoto Consensus,600.0,6.25,SHA-256,2024-05-10T04:00:00Z,False,,"Model Overview
Bitcoin governance is the process by which protocol rules are decided upon, implemented, and enforced. Users (full nodes) adopt new rules according to their subjective views on what Bitcoin is and should be. If two or more individuals adopt the same set of rules, they form an inter-subjective social consensus of what “Bitcoin” is. It is in this respect that many conceptualize Bitcoin as being set by a social contract. Every time rule changes are contemplated, the rules of the contract are decided and renegotiated continuously between stakeholders. Protocol changes are legitimized when users agree to adopt the new changes. Once adopted, the Bitcoin protocol automates the enforcement of the social contract.

Process Overview
Protocol development is governed by a proposal process whereby anyone in the open-source Bitcoin community can submit <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip"">Bitcoin Improvement Proposals</a> (""BIPs""). After debate by the community, when consensus has emerged, the Bitcoin Core maintainers merge code changes into Bitcoin Core's GitHub Repository. Once new code has been implemented into the Bitcoin Core client, users of the network (full nodes) must be persuaded to adopt the new changes. Protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus.

Once rules are adopted on-chain, all new transactions and block proposals are subject to the agreed-upon rules. Full nodes only accept new transactions and block proposals that are valid according to the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. Anything that is not valid will be rejected. Thus, miners must implement the prevailing rules of the network in order to participate in the block creation process. 

User Activated Hard Fork
2017's <a href=""https://messari.io/article/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork"">User Activated Soft Fork Event</a> provided an illustrative case study on Bitcoin governance in practice. 

As early as 2010, shortly after Satoshi implemented a block limit into Bitcoin, discussions around block size began. These discussions largely stayed in the background until 2017 when tensions within the Bitcoin community rose over rising transaction fees and increasingly divergent opinions on scaling Bitcoin. In May 2017, a meeting between miners, businesses, investors, and core developers took place at the Consensus conference in New York, in what is now referred to as the ""New York Agreement"". The product of this meeting was an agreement to support <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/segregated-witness"">SegWit</a> (a soft fork) and a 2MB block size (hard fork). 

Known as SegWit2x, this proposal was backed by over 80% of the network’s hash rate. However, despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate SegWit without the block size increase. This plan was proposed as BIP 148, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, from a pseudonymous developer named <a href=""https://messari.io/person/shaolin-fry"">Shaolinfry</a>. Soon after, users set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would soft fork to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Eventually, enough nodes signaled support for it, forcing miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. 

Many see this user-activated soft fork (UASF) as a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s history. The philosophy underpinning the event was that users controlled the network, not miners. The event not only illustrated the balance of power within Bitcoin's network, but also calmed suspicions that parties such as miners, businesses, or Bitcoin Core developers, controlled Bitcoin.

Block Rewards, Block Time, Hard Forks and Issuance Rate

New ether are generated via block rewards, initially set at 5 Ether per block. Those block rewards incentivize miners to secure the network. Miners that find an uncle block also receive 87.5% of the base block reward. Uncle blocks occur when several distinct miners simultaneously mine a block. In this case, the block that has the most accumulated PoW is conserved, and others are rejected. Unlike the Bitcoin chain that does not reward miners for orphan blocks, the Ethereum chain does reward uncle block miners. Transaction fees, however, are not awarded to uncle block miners. As <a href=""https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin"">Vitalik Buterin</a> notes, the initial intent behind rewarding uncle block miners was to avoid mining centralization caused by the network lag that smaller miners could endure:
  ""This mechanic was originally introduced to reduce centralization pressures, by reducing the advantage that well-connected miners have over poorly connected miners.""

In 2017, the difficulty bomb increased block times drastically, thus reducing the issuance rate. Indeed, the difficulty bomb, also known as ""ice age"" was initially designed as a mechanism to disincentivize miners to continue mining the Ethereum chain by making it exponentially harder to create a new block. This was meant to accelerate the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.

The Casper development and transition to Proof-of-Stake being delayed, <a href=""https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin"">Vitalik Buterin</a> and <a href=""https://messari.io/person/afri-schoedon"">Afri Schoeden</a> proposed to delay the difficulty bomb and reduce the block rewards from 5 Ether to 3 Ether, thus leaving the system in the same general state as before. This proposal, EIP 649, was included in the Byzantium hard fork which was implemented on October 16, 2017, at block 4,370,000, thus effectively reducing block rewards from 5 Ether to 3 Ether and delaying the difficulty bomb for approximately 1.4 years.

On February 28, 2019, at block 7,280,000, the Constantinople hard fork further reduced block rewards from 3 Ether to 2 Ether, and once again delayed the difficulty bomb for approximately 12 months with EIP 1234.

The Ethereum's Parity multi-sig wallet bug

On November 06, 2017, a vulnerability in the ""library"" smart contract code was exploited by an anonymous user. Subsequently, the user destroyed the library contract. This destruction locked forever a total amount of 513,774.16 Ether located in 587 multi-signatures parity wallets. <a href=""https://messari.io/article/messari-proprietary-methods"">Messari Proprietary Methodology</a> to calculate liquid supply excludes any non-transferable coins. Thus, these locked Ether are considered illiquid and are not included in our liquid supply calculation.

ETH 2.0 and the transition to Casper Proof-of-Stake

In ETH 2.0, the Ethereum chain will be maintained via a new proof-of-stake system, where rewards will be distributed on a sliding scale based on the total amount staked on the network. The more total supply that’s staked, the higher the system-wide issuance rate (to incentivize high cumulative participation). Although individual yields will decline as the staking participation increases. A table posted by <a href=""https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin"">Vitalik Buterin</a> on Github lays out the sliding scale issuance rate. 

<a href=""https://messari.io/person/justin-drake"">Justin Drake</a>, a researcher at the <a href=""https://messari.io/organization/ethereum-foundation"">Ethereum Foundation</a>, argued that targeting 30,000,000 ETH at stake, long-term, “seems about right for strong security.” It would represent about 30% of the network and result in an approximate 3% annual inflation. Nevertheless, the penalties applied to validators going offline as well as the slashing penalties and the transaction fees burnt due to EIP 1559 will lead to the destruction of Ether, thus reducing the total net issuance amount.

The transition to Proof-of-Stake will occur in three or four stages, according to the latest specifications shared by the core developers:
Phase 0, expected for Dec. 1, 2020, will initially increase issuance compared to the current level. This is due to the fact that both the Proof-of-Work and Beacon Chain will run simultaneously and rewards will be distributed on both chains, although the staking participation, and thus annual issuance on the Beacon Chain, will most likely be very low during this Phase.
Phase 1, expected for Q4 2021, will allow finalizing the Proof-of-Work chain with Proof-of-Stake. The Proof-of-Work rewards will most likely be reduced to match an issuance rate between 0.5% and 1% (versus 4.5% before Phase 1). Both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake rewards will co-exist and the global issuance rate should be around 1% at that stage.
Phase 1.5, estimated for 2022, will mark when Ethereum 2.0 transfers will likely unlock, giving stakers access to their previously inaccessible staked ETH and accumulated rewards. These rewards and staking amounts will date back to the launch of the Beacon Chain.
Phase 2, estimated for 2023, will progressively lead to an increase of staking participation, thus increasing the annual issuance rate, while Proof-of-Work will simultaneously progressively disappear.

",Inflationary,Fixed Issuance,False,,"Modified GHOST protocol
The Ethereum White Paper states Ethereum uses a modified version of the ""Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree"" (GHOST) protocol to distinguish the ""longest"" base chain (the chain with the most accumulated Proof-of-Work backing it) from forks. <a href=""https://messari.io/article/nakamoto-consensus"">Nakamoto Consensus</a>, the implementation used by Bitcoin (<a href=""https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin"">$BTC</a>) and its forks, is problematic in networks with fast confirmation times (i.e., block times) like Ethereum. Quick block times lead to a higher stale or orphan rate, which can split mining resources among competing forks and reduce overall network security. Accelerated confirmation times also increases the likelihood a single mining pool could obtain a majority of the hashpower on a given chain.

The GHOST protocol attempts to solve this issue of network security by including orphan blocks in the calculation of the longest chain. Therefore, the GHOST model determines the valid chain by weighing the parent and further ancestors as well as the number of stale descendants. The protocol also rewards the mining of orphan blocks directly connected to the longest chain to combat potential centralization concerns. Orphan block miners do not receive any transaction fees, only a portion of the block subsidy, as stale transactions are not considered valid.

Some say GHOST works better in theory than in practice, claiming Ethereum further modified its consensus implementation before (or soon after) launch to avoid security complications. Others suggest the Ethereum consensus model better resembles Nakamoto consensus or a modified version of the Inclusive protocol. But the inclusion of EIP-100 in the Byzantium fork changed Ethereum's difficulty calculation algorithm to include orphan blocks, which indicates the proposed modified GHOST implementation is intact. Regardless of the security model classification, Ethereum continues to reward orphan block miners with 87.5% of the base block reward.

Mining
Ethereum miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks by running the Ethash <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work"">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a> algorithm. In this process, miners compete to discover a valid hash, using the Keccak-256 and Keccak-512 hash functions, as defined by Ethereum's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Unlike Bitcoin's biweekly adjustments, Ethereum recalculates its difficulty level every block based on the time between the two previous blocks.

Cryptographers designed Ethash to be <a href=""https://messari.io/blog/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics"">ASIC</a>-resistant by making it memory intensive for specialized mining chips. But the popularity of Ethereum led mining chip manufacturer Bitmain to release the first ASICs miners for Ethash in April 2018. The majority of the Ethereum remains opposed to ASIC miners, as evidenced by its support for the ProgPoW EIP (a likely inclusion in the second Istanbul hard fork). Ethereum also plans to transition to a <a href=""https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake"">Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</a> consensus model, which would render any mining equipment obsolete.",Proof-of-Work,,15.0,2.0,Ethash,,False,,"Ethereum operates similarly to Bitcoin through off-chain, informal governance. In this model, developers can submit protocol upgrades, dubbed <a href=""https://messari.io/article/ethereum-improvement-proposal-eip"">Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)</a>, on Ethereum's open-source GitHub repository. Core Ethereum developers then discuss new proposals, with additional input from the extended community. If approved by a majority vote, core developers merge the changes into the base code. To avoid complications post-merge, node operators must update their clients to the latest software.",No On-Chain Governance,"While Ethereum does not have an official on-chain governance model, it does have a history with coin voting. The three instances listed below are examples of loosely couple coin voting:
- [DAO proposal votes](https://daostats.github.io/proposals.html)
- [The DAO Carbonvote](http://v1.carbonvote.com/)
- [The EIP 186/649/669 Carbonvote](http://carbonvote.com/)

Loosely coupled coin voting still coordinates the details of the proposal off-chain, but participants submit their votes on-chain, with each vote weighted by the total amount of ether held by that address. Despite the correlation between voting weight and tokens held, users do not submit tokens alongside their votes and are therefore not subject to any direct financial burden. Hence, the loosely coupled label given to this style of governance by Vitalik Buterin.

Ethereum does not have any examples of coin voting as a built-in layer-1 protocol feature (referred to as tightly couple coin voting). But networks miners engage in a tightly couple voting process when determining whether to change the block gas limit.

Launchpad
As a <a href=""https://messari.io/article/the-evolution-of-crypto-capital-markets"">progression </a>of the ICO, Binance first popularized the <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/initial-exchange-offering-ieo"">initial exchange offering (IEO)</a> when they announced in January 2019 that they would be selling tokens directly through the exchange every month. Initially, the sales were done on a first come first serve basis. They since pivoted to a lottery system where users can claim tickets based on the number of BNB tokens held over the prior 20 days. The tickets represent a certain allocation of tokens and are drawn randomly. If selected, the user is committed to purchasing that number of tokens at the listed price. 

Binance Chain
BNB acts as the native token used as gas to pay for network transactions on Binance Chain, a high-performance blockchain network. It initially operates with a small pre-selected validator set, but the plan is to transition to a <a href=""https://messari.io/article/delegated-proof-of-stake"">delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS)</a> consensus mechanism where users can vote using their BNB for delegates that will validate blocks to secure the network. There is also a built-in governance module to let BNB holders submit proposals by depositing tokens which are then voted on. 
",Crowdsale,"
Binance pre-mined 200 million Binance Coins prior to the public sale. Binance Coin’s distribution process had three phases: allocation to founders, allocation to investors, and a public sale.  
Founders received 80 million BNB (40% of supply) vested over four years. Half of the founders’ allocation was vested immediately. The other half is vested annually through 2021. From Q2 2019, these tokens will be burnt through quarterly burns and will thus remain illiquid until they are burnt.  Binance plans to burn 100 million BNB (50% of supply) over time and has successfully executed nine coin burns to date.
Investors receive 20 million BNB (10% of supply) with no vesting or lock-up restrictions. 
The public sale distributed 100 million BNB (50% of supply). Binance launched the ERC-20 Binance Coin in a public sale on July 14, 2017. Half of the funds raised through Binance’s coin offering were intended for Binance branding and marketing, and roughly one-third of the funds were for platform upgrades and development.

Binance executed the token swap from ERC-20 BNB tokens to Binance chain mainnet BNB coins on April 23, 2019. Binance Coins native to the Binance chain are called BEP2 BNB. Pre-selected validators produced blocks after the genesis block on April 18, 2019, and the first ERC-20 to BEP2 BNB swap of 5 million BNB was executed to a wallet belonging to Binance.","[{'title': 'Initial Coin Offering (ICO)', 'start_date': '2017-07-01T05:00:00Z', 'type': 'Public', 'details': 'The sale occurred over three periods each lasting a week and with their own respective price (0.00037 ETH, 0.0004ETH, 0.00043ETH).

In July 2019, Binance announced that it will burn the BNB tokens allocated to the Binance team going forward. As a result, the team allocation, that was initially supposed to be vesting for 4 years, will remain illiquid until all 80,000,000 BNB have been burnt.

77.8% was allocated to Ripple
0.2% was airdropped as an experiment to try and expand usage as part of the launch.

In 2014, Chris Larsen committed 7 billion XRP from his allocation to a charitable foundation. Jed McCaleb donated 2 billion of his allocation to a donor-advised fund. In 2014 McCaleb negotiated an exit agreement from the project dictating his remaining allocation would be held in a custodial account and released to him on a monthly schedule. A daily cap on the amount he can sell of the tokens released is included in the agreement. Today, Ripple’s selling restrictions on co-founder Jed McCaleb allow him to sell his allocation at a theoretical maximum rate of 1% of daily trading volume.

XRP is burned to pay fees for transactions via Ripplenet. Nevertheless, XRP liquid and circulating supply are massively inflationary. 

In December 2017, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP into escrow in order to alleviate concerns that a massive amount of XRP could hit the market all at once with substantial negative price impact. 1 billion is being released monthly to support Ripple’s ongoing operation of Ripplenet. Any unused funds are returned to escrow at the end of the month. On average Ripple re-escrows 700 million and 300 million XRP become liquid each month.

Ripple generated revenue from ongoing XRP sales, which account for well over 90% of the company's revenue. There are two types of XRP sales that the company discloses:
Programmatic sales: These come from the company’s XRP reserve, and can be sold at a rate of no more than 0.25% of average daily volume on defined exchanges. 
Direct sales from XRP II: These come from direct bespoke deals with institutional clients, and include (per Ripple’s 2016-2017 disclosures) reselling restrictions to ensure its partners do not purchase XRP at a discount from the company and then immediately flood the market with sales.

Ripple has sold over 1.2 billion USD worth of XRP through Direct Sales and Programmatic Sales. 

Our liquid supply curve takes into account the Ripple Escrow mechanism as well as the Founder' selling agreement to calculate liquid supply. As such, even though XRP's outstanding supply is deflationary over time through fee-burning, circulating and liquid supply are massively inflationary due to escrow release, founder's distributions, and Ripple sales. At the current burn rate, it would take 20 years for the XRP Ledger to burn what is distributed by Ripple and its founders every day.

This process occurs until a supermajority (80%) of UNL nodes have matching ledgers.

Solana's three pre-launch private sales all came with a nine-month lockup after the network launched. The tokens issued in these sales should become liquid around Jan. 7, 2021. The project's public auction sale (held in Mar. 2020) did not come with a lockup schedule, and the SOL tokens distributed in that sale (which totaled 1.6% of the initial supply) were fully liquid once the network launched.

The founder's allocation (12.5% of the initial supply) will also be subject to a nine-month lockup post-network launch. After the lockup period ends, these tokens will vest monthly for another two years (expected to fully vest by Jan. 2023).

The Grant Pool and Community Reserve (both overseen by the Solana Foundation) contain ~38% of the initial SOL supply combined. These allocations began to vest in small amounts since Solana's mainnet launch. One million Grant Pool tokens vested every three months for the first nine months, and 35 million Community Reserve tokens vested in 5 million token increments over the same timeframe. The entire allocations for these categories will unlock in Jan. 2021.

The Solana Foundation's allocation began vesting in small increments every month following the network's launch. The foundation also unlocked 11,365,067 SOL at launch to lend to a market maker for six months. After disclosing this information to SOL holders, the team opted to burn an equivalent amount of tokens from the foundation's allocation.

Ongoing Emissions
Solana validators voted to enable <a href=""https://messari.io/intel/event/61adff26-b903-4ab9-8329-952d6a555228"">""pico-inflation""</a> on Dec. 24, 2020. The SOL supply is now inflating at an annual rate of 0.1%, with newly minted tokens going to validators and stakers in proportion to their staked amounts. This relatively low inflation rate is only temporary and will be replaced by a more substantial and permanent inflation proposal at some point in 2021.

This ""final"" inflation proposal includes an initial annual inflation rate of 8%. However, this inflation rate will decrease at an annual rate of 15% (""dis-inflation rate""). Solana's inflation rate will continue to decrease until it reaches an annual rate of 1.5%, which the network should reach in about ten years or 2031. 1.5% will remain the long-term inflation rate for Solana unless the network's governance system votes to change it.",Inflationary,Decreasing Inflation rate,False,,"Solana's Proof of Stake (PoS) based consensus mechanism, specifically called Tower BFT, leverages the network's Proof of History (PoH) technique as a clock before consensus to reduce communication overhead and latency.

Each time a validator votes on a particular fork, voting is restricted to a fixed period of hashes called a slot. The current network setting has around 400 milliseconds (ms) for one slot. Every 400ms, the network has a potential rollback point, but every subsequent vote doubles the amount of time that the network would have to stall before it can unroll that vote. In short, secondary votes make it much harder to undo the transactions executed in a particular slot. Therefore, a block with several votes has a greater chance of remaining a part of the chain permanently.

As an example, each validator has voted 32 times in the last 12 seconds. The vote 12 seconds ago now will have a timeout of 2³² slots or roughly 54 years. Effectively, this vote will never be rolled back by the network. Whereas the most recent vote has a timeout of two slots or about 800ms. As new blocks are added to the ledger, old blocks are increasingly likely to be confirmed because the number of slots old votes is committed to doubles every slot. Tower BTF offers finality once two-thirds of network validators have voted on some order of events. Once transactions are finalized, they can't be rolled back.

The Solana mainnet is planned to operate in delegated-Proof-of-Stake (dPoS), in which token holders can participate in the block production process and earn rewards by either stake token and become a validator themselves, or delegate their tokens to validators they trust.

Any individual can become a validator on the network and contribute to the overall security of the protocol. There is no minimum staking requirement, although the leader selection process (which validator gets to propose the next block) is stake-weighted. The network architecture is designed to scale with bandwidth and hardware, utilizing GPU cores to parallelize execution and reduce verification times. Due to the GPU requirement, hardware expectations are slightly higher than some protocols. Estimated costs for a satisfactory setup are around $5,000.",Proof-of-Stake,Tower BFT,,,,,,,"The Solana Foundation, a Swiss non-profit organization, owns Solana’s IP and will help set the broad development direction for the network alongside Solana Labs. The code is open source, allowing community developers to contribute and provide input on proposed protocol updates. Solana Labs will remain a core contributor to the protocol and help propose and support network upgrades and new features.",No On-Chain Governance,"Solana does not have plans for on-chain governance at the moment. It has a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) system that allows token holders to select the validator set. However, the project does not have a roadmap for a token-weighted voting system.",,,

Ouroboros consensus is determined by slot leaders who are elected by token holders with a sufficient stake in the network. Slot leaders operate in epochs to listen for and confirm transactions to produce blocks, which are then approved by input endorsers.

","Centralized Distribution, Private Sale","Terra Core facilitates the creation of many fiat-pegged currencies, facilitated by Luna the staking token. The genesis issuance of Luna is 1 billion, with initial allocations broken down in accordance with the following:  

Terraform Labs (10%): Used to facilitate the research & development of the Terra Project. can be found in the accounts/terraform-labs directory.  Terraform Labs also holds an additional 4.5% of the LUNA supply on behalf of investors who did not clear KYC in time for their token sale, and thus manually claim tokens for Terraform Labs rather than having their tokens programmatically vest from the genesis block.

Employees & Contributor Pool (20%): Used to compensate employees and contributors of the project. Some part of the coins have already been granted, and can be found in the accounts/employees directory. Currently 4.7% of this pool has been granted.  

Terra Alliance (20%): The Terra Alliance is key to driving early adoption and usage for Terra. We will be using this pool to set incentives, mainly marketing discount programs (such as coupons for users) and volume incentives for alliance partners. Terraform Labs will be playing custodian for this pool, taking input from the community to best allocate resources from this pool.  

Stability Reserves (20%): Bootstrapping stablecoins is no easy feat, with threats to the peg coming from every adversarial angle. Stability reserves will be to manage the network's early stability close to genesis.  

Genesis liquidity (4%): 4% of Luna will be made available to the market close to genesis to allow everyday users to use and interact with it.

Investors (26%):  

In order to finance the development of the Terra Project, Terraform Labs held three token sales:  

Seed-sale: 16 cents per Luna, sold ~192M tokens. Lockup 10 - 18 months, with 30% early liquidity.
Private-sale: 80 cents per Luna, sold ~18M tokens. Lockup 3 months, with 6 months linear vest thereafter.  

Terra also minted 1 billion SDT (SDR stablecoin) at genesis. This SDT reserve exists to augment Terra's stability mechanism. Core to Terra's stability mechanism is the swapping of stablecoins to Luna - and while this is effective in normal conditions, when there is large changes in stablecoin demand in either direction the cost for the swap increases significantly: swap fees increase quadratically as one side of the fee is favored (and normalizes back over time), so in times of rapid demand change the fee goes up significantly, which makes it difficult to accommodate payment operations requiring a very tight spread. During times like this Terraform Labs swaps SDT to KRT and sells that for KRW to Chai. When Chai merchants settle out, Terraform Labs maintains that KRW in a fiat reserve to buy back KRT.","[{'title': 'Preseed ', 'start_date': None, 'type': 'Private', 'details': '1 Year Lock Up', 'end_date': '2018-05-31T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': 'USD', 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.1, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 10000000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Seed', 'start_date': '2018-10-31T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private', 'details': '10 month lockup', 'end_date': '2018-10-31T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.23, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 23000000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Private Sale', 'start_date': None, 'type': 'Private', 'details': '3 month lockup + 6 month linear vesting', 'end_date': None, 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.8, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 14500000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}]",[],"[{'account_type': 'Treasury', 'asset_held': {'id': None, 'name': None}, 'addresses': [{'name': 'Terraform Labs Wallet', 'link': 'https://finder.terra.money/columbus-3/account/terra1dp0taj85ruc299rkdvzp4z5pfg6z6swaed74e6'}], 'security': None}]",,[],1000000000.0,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': 26, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': 30, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': None}",,2019-04-24T04:00:00Z,"
",Burn & Mint,Other Burn & Mint models,,,"Terra Core is based on Tendermint, which relies on a set of validators that are responsible for committing new blocks in the blockchain. These validators participate in the consensus protocol by broadcasting votes which contain cryptographic signatures signed by each validator's private key.  

Validator candidates can bond their own Luna and have Luna ""delegated"", or staked, to them by token holders. The Columbus Mainnet will have 100 validators, but over time this will increase to 300 validators according to a predefined schedule. The validators are determined by who has the most stake delegated to them — the top 100 validator candidates with the most stake will become Terra validators.  

Validators and their delegators will earn the following fees:  * 

Compute fees: To prevent spamming, validators may set minimum gas fees for transactions to be included in their mempool. At the end of every block, the compute fees are disbursed to the participating validators pro-rata to stake.   
Stability fees: To stabilize the value of Luna, the protocol charges a small percentage transaction fee ranging from 0.1% to 1% on every Terra transaction, capped at 1 TerraSDR. This is paid in any Terra currency, and is disbursed pro-rata to stake at the end of every block in TerraSDR.   
Seigniorage rewards: Validators that participate in the Exchange Rate Oracle get a portion of seigniorage if they faithfully report and win the ballot (vote within the reward band around the weighted median).  

Besides revenue, there are scarcity incentives:*   

Swap fees: A small spread is charged on atomic swap transactions between Luna and any Terra currency, which is burned and creates scarcity in Luna and indirectly rewards validators. Note that validators can set commission on the fees their delegators receive as additional incentive.  

If validators double sign, are frequently offline or do not participate in governance, their staked Luna (including Luna of users that delegated to them) can be slashed. The penalty depends on the severity of the violation.",Delegated Proof-of-Stake,,5.0,,,,,,,Direct On-Chain Vote,"Terra's Governance module inherits from Cosmos' SDK gov module. Within Terra, governance is the process through which participants within the network can effect change on the protocol by submitting petitions known as proposals, arriving at a popular consensus when a threshold amount of support has been reached for it. The proposal structure is versatile and allows for holders of LUNA tokens to voice their opinion on both blockchain parameter updates as well as future development of the Terra protocol.  

There are 5 potential proposal types: Text Proposals, Parameter Change Proposals, Community Pool Spend Proposals, Tax Rate/Reward Weight Update Proposals, and Software Upgrade Proposals.  

- Text Proposals are used for creating general-purpose petitions, such as asking the Core team to implement a specific feature. The community can reference a passed Text Proposal to the core developers to indicate that a feature (requiring potentially a soft or hard fork) is in significant demand.  
- Parameter Change Proposals are a special type of proposal which, once passed, will automatically go in effect by directly altering the network's parameter specified. For each module, you can find the parameters associated with it by browsing to the Parameters section of the module specification.  
- The Community Pool Spend Proposal defines a special proposal that upon being passed, will disburse the coins specified in Amount to the Recipient account using funds from the Community Pool.  
- The Tax Rate/Reward Update Proposal defines special proposals which allow the Tax Rate and Reward Weight values to be voted on and changed accordingly, subject to the policy constraints.  
- Software Upgrade Proposals are for the moment considered unavailable, as they have not yet been implemented. They thus share the same semantics as a simple Text Proposal.",,,

Note:
The liquid supply curve represents estimated liquid supply entering circulation, including inflation by way of staking rewards, and existing illiquid supply that is unlocked and deemed liquid over time. Further, burned supply is not included in the liquid supply curve.",Inflationary,"Burn & Mint Equilibrium, Programmatic Burn",True,720000000.0,"Avalanche utilizes a DAG-optimized novel family of Proof-of-Stake consensus protocols collectively called Snow. The family consists of three components – Slush, Snowflake, and Snowball. Snowflake and Snowball are leaderless Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocols built around Slush, a non-BFT metastable mechanism. Inspired by gossip algorithms, consensus gains its properties through the metastable mechanism whereby the system operates by repeatedly sampling the network at random and steering correct nodes towards a common outcome. 

The metastable mechanism aims to quickly move a large network to an irreversible state, where the irreversibility implies that a sufficiently large portion of the network has accepted a proposal, and a conflicting proposal will not be accepted with any higher than negligible probability. 

In simple terms, Avalanche's consensus is leaderless by design. Transactions are verified by having nodes communicate with each other at random until a sufficiently large portion of them reach an agreement. A validator's chance of being sampled is proportional to their AVAX stake. A validator will receive a staking reward if they are online and respond for more than 80% of their validation period, as measured by a majority of validators. The minimum amount that a validator must stake is 2,000 AVAX. Avalanche's leaderless design allows it to waive slashing penalties, which can otherwise act as a deterrent to prospective stakers. Ultimately, this approach is aimed at maximizing its total validator set.

Further, because Avalanche is a lightweight protocol, the minimum computer requirements are quite modest and do not require special computer hardware.

· Hardware: 8 core CPU   = 2 GHz, RAM: 16 GB, Storage: 200 GB free space.
· OS: Ubuntu   = 18.04 or Mac OS X   = Catalina. (Ubuntu versions older than 18.04 may work but have not been tested.)
· Network: IPv4 or IPv6 network connection, with an open public port, capable of at least 30Mbps throughput.

Requirements scale with the amount of AVAX staked on the node. A large node (100k+ AVAX staked) gets the most significant instance to ensure the node doesn't fall behind and jeopardize staking rewards. A small node (less than 10k AVAX staked) can run a healthy node on a below-spec computer.",Proof-of-Stake,,,,,,,,,"Direct On-Chain Vote, Upcoming","AVAX provides on-chain governance for critical network parameters where participants can vote on changes to the network and settle network upgrade decisions democratically. Parameters include factors such as the minimum staking amount and minting rate. This enables the platform to effectively perform dynamic parameter optimization through a crowd oracle. Avalanche does not allow unlimited changes to arbitrary aspects of the system. Instead, only a pre-determined number of parameters can be modified via governance, rendering the system more predictable and increasing safety. Further, all governable parameters are subject to limits within specific time bounds, ensuring that the system remains predictable over short time ranges.",,,

It serves four functions: payment for fees, governance over the network, interoperability, and bonding. When messages are sent between two blockchains on the network, DOT's are used to pay for fees. DOT holders are also responsible for managing significant events by voting on protocol upgrades and fixes. The token also ensures that network participants act in a manner that does not damage the network by giving them skin in the game. In order to create new parachains, tokens must be bonded ensuring incentive alignment.

How to stake DOTs
While validators on Polkadot need to maintain the (often expensive) hardware necessary to secure the network, anyone can assume the role of a nominator by bonding their DOTs to a dedicated validator. Bonding tokens helps increase the network’s cost of attack and allows DOT holders to earn newly minted tokens as staking rewards. Polkadot is targeting about a 75% stake rate, which at a 10% inflation rate in the network’s inaugural year, would provide an annual staking return of~20%. Bonded tokens will remain locked for twelve weeks and are subject to slashing (loss of funds) should the chosen validator go offline or misbehave.

Polkadot Wallet
There are multiple teams working on Polkadot wallet implementations prior to network launch. Most notably, blockchain.com announced that it will integrate DOT tokens into its wallet allowing users to store, send and receive tokens as well as participate in governance by voting on proposals.",Crowdsale,"In Oct. 2017, the Web 3.0 Foundation raised the equivalent of $145 million in ether (ETH) through a token sale. The sale was split between a private sale, which raised over $80 million, and a public sale, which raised the remainder. Participants were required to use a KYC system called PICOPS, which verifies the identity of each participant. Participants that were unable to verify themselves were deemed ineligible. The sale was also not available to any Chinese or American citizens due to regulatory concerns. 

At the start of the network, a total of 10 million DOT (old) will be created as a native token. The initial supply was later redenominated by a community vote, a cosmetic change that increased token account balances by 100x. The following allocations are the same for both DOT (old) and new DOT:

50% allocated to token sale investors
5% allocated to the 2019 private sale investors
3.4% allocated to 2020 token sale investors
11.6% retained by the Foundation for future fundraising efforts
30% allocated to the Web 3 Foundation for immediate use to develop the Polkadot network and other undisclosed Foundation activities.

The total supply is not fixed at 1 billion but instead will use a to be determined inflationary model to supply the rewards for the proof-of-stake (<a href=""https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake"">PoS</a>) system. 

On Nov. 6, 2017, a vulnerability was exploited in the Parity multi-sig wallet containing over 500,000 ETH, including $98 million of the $140 million+ in ETH raised through the Polkadot ICO. These funds are currently frozen, and a debate among the Ethereum community will determine whether these funds can or will ever be recovered. Even if the funds are lost, the Parity team does not believe this will impact their development roadmap.

In Jun. 2019, The Web3 Foundation announced it sold another 500,000 DOT (old) tokens (now 50 million new DOT) to an undisclosed group of private investors. Based on previous reports from Polkadot, the project was seeking to raise $60 million at a $1.2 billion valuation through this token sale. The Jun. 2019 announcement declared the raise successful, implying the Polkadot reached its target.","[{'title': 'Dutch Auction (Initial Coin Offering)', 'start_date': '2017-10-14T04:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private', 'details': 'Due to the recent redenomination, the supply sold in this private auction is now equal to 275,862,100 *New DOT*, which would make the original sale price $0.29 per token.', 'end_date': '2017-10-27T04:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 2758621, 'asset_collected': 'ETH', 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 28.8, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 80000000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': []}, {'title': 'Dutch Auction (Initial Coin Offering)', 'start_date': '2017-10-15T04:00:00Z', 'type': 'Public', 'details': 'Due to the recent redenomination, the supply sold in this public auction is now equal to 224,137,900 *New DOT*, which would make the original sale price $0.29 per token.', 'end_date': '2017-10-27T04:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 2241379, 'asset_collected': 'ETH', 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 28.8, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 65000000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': ['China', 'United States']}, {'title': 'SAFT', 'start_date': '2019-01-24T05:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private', 'details': 'In Jan. 2019, the Wall Street Journal [reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-startup-polkadot-seeking-new-token-sale-above-1-billion-valuation-11548377842) Polkadot, under the management of the Web3 Foundation, was seeking to raise another $60 million by privately selling up to 500,000 DOT (old), which would place a fully-diluted market value on outstanding DOTs of $1.2 billion.

It is originally suggested that 20% will go to block producers and the other 80% will go to the treasury (instead of burning) to keep better control of inflation/deflation. The impact of the burn mechanism of transaction fees and slashing fees has not been computed to draw the supply curve.",Inflationary,Dynamic Emission,,,"Polkadot uses what it calls a hybrid consensus, which separates finality from the block production mechanism. At a high level, Polkadot allows the network to produce blocks at a rapid pace while permitting the slower finality agent to run in a separate process, thereby not affecting transaction execution times. This design theoretically helps overcome the issues associated with probabilistic finality, namely the chance of unknowingly following an incorrect fork or the inability to produce new blocks (aka stalling).

The two mechanisms that power Polkadot’s consensus include:
BABE: The Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension (BABE) is the block production mechanism. It assigns block production slots to randomly selected validators according to stake (as defined by the Polkadot randomness cycle).
GRANDPA: The GHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement (GRANDPA) is the finality gadget for the Polkadot relay chain. This agent reaches agreements on chains rather than blocks, which could speed up the finalization process. Polkadot helps elaborate on this definition by stating if “more than 2/3 of validators attest to a chain containing a certain block, all blocks leading up to that one are finalized at once.”

While the core technology of Polkadot is the relay chain, the network reaches consensus through a modified and proprietary PoS mechanism consisting of four key participants: collators, validators, nominators, and fishermen.

Collator
Each parachain has a collator that fulfills the task of a miner in a <a href=""https://messari.io/article/proof-of-work"">proof-of-work</a> (PoW) blockchain. A collator must maintain the Polkadot relay chain state as well as the state of the parachain. The collator then manages the queue of transactions going into and out of the parachain from the relay chain. Collators collect parachain transactions, produce state transition proofs, create new candidate blocks and then pass them along to validators in exchange for a fee for their work. In a competitive market with many collators, collators can incentivize validators to choose their block by sharing a portion of their fee with the validator.

Validators
Validators are randomly nominated to accept block candidates from parachain collators, verify the information in the block, and republish the block candidate to the Polkadot relay chain. Once a validator confirms a block, they also validate and change the state of the relay chain block by moving the transaction data from the originating parachain’s input queue to the destination parachain’s output queue. Validators are incentivized through a staking mechanism that requires them to stake Polkadot (DOT) tokens to the network to be chosen as an active validator. Validators that break the consensus algorithm are punished by losing a portion of their stake, while those that correctly secure the network and verify blocks are rewarded with new tokens.

Nominators
Nominators are those who may be unable to participate in the transaction validation process directly, so they instead contribute tokens to a validator of their choice. Nominators receive a pro-rata share of the validator reward based on their portion of the validator’s bond, so nominators are incentivized to choose a validator most likely to receive the largest reward. The team believes the nominator process will create a competitive, but honest, marketplace for high-quality validators and nominators.

Fishermen
Fishermen do not participate in the transaction validation process with validators and nominators, but instead, act as watchmen monitoring activity across the Polkadot network and identify validators who break consensus rules. Fishermen stake a smaller bond of tokens than a validator but receive a proportionally larger reward than validators for their role in securing the network.",Proof-of-Stake,Nominated Proof-of-Stake,,,,,,,"Parity Technologies, with oversight from the Web3 Foundation, built the Polkadot protocol and Substrate framework and controlled much of the process during the project's initial stages. This governance system remained intact through Polkadot's mainnet launch and early existence. In late Jul. 2020, control over the protocol was transferred to the network's proposed on-chain governance system, which takes into consideration token holders, validators, a Council, and a Technical Committee. These network participants are now the primary source of upgrade submissions and approvals. Parity and Web3 can still develop and submit proposals of their own, but they must pass through the governance system before being implemented.",Delegated On-Chain Vote,"Polkadot’s future on-chain governance system that hands the future direction of the protocol over to a technical council, an on-chain entity consisting of members voted in by network stakeholders. This system will allow active token holders and Council members to propose codebase changes by bonding a minimum amount of DOTs to the network to ensure some economic buy-in. Other token holders can also deposit an equivalent amount of tokens to the proposal to support it. The top proposals by stake amount are selected to be a referendum, which Polkadot defines as “inclusive, stake-based voting schemes.” Bonded tokens are returned once the proposal is brought to a vote. If the proposal originates within the Council, Council members can approve the raw submission internally and move the proposal to a referendum.

Every 30 days, a new referendum is brought to a vote, with separate queues for Council and public submissions. To vote, token holders must lock up their tokens “for at least the enactment delay period,” which could stretch beyond the end of the referendum, to ensure economic buy-in and discourage vote selling.

What determines if the proposal passes the vote depends on which entity proposed the referendum. Polkadot references [three possible scenarios](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#tallying):
- If a public submission, Positive Turnout Bias (Super-Majority Approve)
- If a Council submission that reaches a “Complete agreement,” Negative Turnout Bias (Super-Majority Against)
- If a Council submission that reaches a “Majority agreement,” Simple Majority

At genesis, the [Council](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#council) began with thirteen members, represented as on-chain accounts. There are plans to increase this total over the following nine months to a max of 24. DOT holders vote these representatives into their privileged positions via a network-wide election process. All members have a fixed term of one year, although any representative can be removed early via a referendum. Network participants rely on the Council for two primary tasks: proposing new referenda and canceling possibly malicious proposals. Members must reach a unanimous agreement to carry out a referendum cancellation.

Polkadot also employs a [Technical Committee](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#technical-committee), first introduced in the Kusama rollout, as one of the three chambers of its governance system. Committee representatives consist of teams that previously “implemented or specified either Polkadot/Kusama runtime or the runtime environment.” The Council has the power to either add or remove Technical Committee teams by a simple majority vote. The committee’s sole purpose is to produce emergency referenda in the event of a dire situation. These proposals get fast-tracked for Council voting and implementation.

This governance design is in practice at the moment on the Kusama network. Its upgrade to CC3 on Nov. 28, 2019, unlocked its on-chain governance capabilities, enabling stakeholders to submit and vote on potential code changes. Through this process, Kusama participants already increased the network validator count beyond its base level and unlocked KSM token transfers.

This token serves the following purposes:
Fees: MATIC token's primary use case is to pay for the transaction fees in the network. The token is designed to be a utility token that functions as the unit of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the Polygon ecosystem.
Staking: Matic sidechains enforce consensus using a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) layer in which network participants stake MATIC to participate as validators and earn staking rewards. Computational resources are required for performing various functions on the Polygon Network, such as validating blocks and publishing proofs. MATIC inflation serves to reward these resource providers to bootstrap security and maintain network integrity.","Initial Exchange Offering, Private Sale","The initial token distribution is as follows:

In order to participate in the consensus process on the Matic Network, users are required to stake MATIC tokens as an indication of that user's commitment to the process. Matic's commit chains also feature slashing (removal of staked funds) to dissuade stakers from submitting invalid blocks, illegally verifying blocks, or executing invalid transactions. Requiring validators to put funds at risk before they can participate in consensus helps maintain the integrity of the network.

Matic's existing PoS chain consists of two layers:
The Bor (Block Producer Layer): Responsible for aggregating transactions into blocks
Heimdall layer (Validator Layer): Supports all validator nodes (stakers) that work alongside Matic's Staking contracts on Ethereum to manage validator accounts, enforce slashing, and issue rewards. Heimdall has been implemented by building on top of the Tendermint consensus engine with changes to the signature scheme and various data structures. It is responsible for block validation, block producer committee selection, and checkpointing a representation of the sidechain blocks to Ethereum in our architecture. Heimdall handles the aggregation of blocks produced by Bor into a Merkle tree and publishes the Merkle root to the root chain periodically.",Proof-of-Stake,,2.1,,,,False,,,No On-Chain Governance,,True,,

It represents the core medium of exchange and unit of account for native transactions. It primarily serves the following purposes:
Security: Stakers receive awards in NEAR by staking their tokens and contributing to network security. NEAR's user of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) provides Sybil resistance from DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks.
Network Fees: The utility of the network is provided by storing application data and providing a way to change it by issuing transactions. The network charges transaction fees for processing the changes to this stored data. The NEAR network collects and automatically burns these fees, such that higher usage will lead to more NEAR tokens being burned. A minimum percentage of smart contract usage fees is allocated for developer rewards. This reward effectively incentivizes early application development that increase network use. When a contract is called, some portion of the transaction fees is generated by the network is automatically allocated to the contract. A minimum value has ben set as a system-level parameter and the developers can choose any value to or above this minimum value.

The network issues inflation rewards at a rate of 5% per year. Of these epoch rewards, 90% (4.5% total) goes to validators, and the remaining 10% (0.5% total) will go to the protocol treasury. Near also burns 70% of all transaction fees; therefore, real inflation (rewards - fees burned) could be less than 5% depending on the level of network activity. The other 30% of a transaction's fee will be rebated to the smart contracts touched by the transaction.

Near Economics Paper",Inflationary,Fixed Inflation rate,,,"The consensus mechanism implemented on NEAR is called Nightshade. Nightshade models the system as a single blockchain. The list of all the transactions in each block is split into physical chunks, one chunk per shard. All chunks accumulate to one block. Note that chunks can only be validated by nodes that maintain the state of that shard. 

Theoretically, each logical block contains all the transactions for all the shards. However, since transmitting a logical block across the network would be prohibitively expensive, it is never initiated. Instead, each network participant maintains the state that corresponds to the shards that they validate transactions for and any additional shard that they want to track. 

The consensus is based on the heaviest chain consensus. Meaning, once a block producer publishes a block, they collect the signatures of validator nodes. The weight of a block is then the cumulative stake of all the signers whose signatures are included in the block. The weight of a chain is the sum of the block weights. Additionally, the consensus utilises a finality gadget that introduces additional slashing conditions for higher chain security.

These governance discussions take place within the NEAR forum. Proposals typically go through a draft stage where they are open to community feedback and scrutiny. If proposals receive enough support, NEAR development teams will build a spec and aim to merge the change. The timing of the proposal's implementation will depend on the change's urgency (e.g., a hotfix for a critical bug would be administered almost immediately).

Mining

Miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks using a Scypt algorithm. In this process, miners compete to generate a <a href=""https://messari.io/blog/hash-function"">hash</a> less than the target number set by Litecoin's <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level"">difficulty adjustment algorithm</a>. Similar to Bitcoin, the target difficulty level is adjusted every 2016 blocks; however, due to Litecoin's 2.5 minute block times, Litecoin's difficulty level adjusts more quickly than Bitcoin's.

Litecoin originally implemented the Scrypt algorithm for its memory intensive properties, which made it more resistant to <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics"">ASICs</a>; however, over time Litecoin's ASIC resistant properties have eroded with Scrypt-capable ASICs having been developed. Furthermore, in order to smooth individual miner revenue as mining has become more competitive, mining is now done in pools where participants contribute <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/hash-power"">hash power</a> to the pool and receive a proportional share of the profits if the pool finds a valid block.",Proof-of-Work,Nakamoto Consensus,150.0,12.5,Scrypt,2023-07-11T08:00:00Z,False,,"Litecoin developement is open to the open source community.

The public auction sold 25 million ALGOs (0.25% of the initial supply) at $2.40 per token, raising a total of $60,402,220. United States citizens were not permitted to participate in the sale. Buyers have the right at any point during the first year of purchase to re-sell tokens back to the Foundation at 90% of the purchase price. Algorand initially planned to hold a series of these Dutch auctions to distribute a total of 3 billion ALGOs (30% of supply), but no further token sales have been announced.

The end of the sale coincided with the Algorand’s mainnet launch, which created 10 billion ALGOs at genesis. A total of 2.5 billion ALGO tokens (25% of the initial supply) were granted to the founders and the Algorand Foundation to support continued protocol development. The rest of the ALGO will be distributed through rewards, grants, and auctions as detailed in the supply curve section.

Even though the entirety of the supply was minted at the launch of the network, thus giving Algorand a fixed outstanding supply, the liquid supply will inflate as pre-minted tokens unlock and are distributed, as described below.

End-user grants are dedicated to open-source developers and community members to help incentivize protocol development and innovation. The ALGOs will be distributed via various programs like hackathons, competitions, and events.

There will be a maximum of 10 billion ALGOs in circulation (minus the 20.5 million burned ALGOs from the inaugural auction early redemption program in Aug. 2019 as well as the 5 million burned Algos from the final auction redemption window in Jul. 2020). The ALGOs will be introduced into the network over time as follows:

Estimated ALGOs to be injected into circulation (initially via auction, distributed over time) - 2.5 billion
Estimated participation rewards (distributed over time) - 1.9 billion
Early relay node runners (distributed over time) - 3.1 billion
Algorand, Inc. - 2.0 billion 
Algorand Foundation - 0.5 billion

Auction refund program
In Aug. 2019, Algorand offered auction investors the opportunity to receive a 90% refund on their purchased tokens. Investor returns totaled $19.9 million tokens, which constituted almost 80% of the original auction supply. The Algorand Foundation later burned these ALGOs as well as the 609,343.1208 AGLOs that address received as participation rewards (aka inflation), permanently removing them from circulation.

In Jun. 2020, the 2019 Algo auction participants who did not avail of the early redemption window in Aug. 2019 qualified to opt for a second and final Auction redemption window. Investor returns totaled five million ALGO. As occurred during the optional early redemption in August 2019, all Algos returned via this refund mechanism were burned (permanently taken out of circulation).

Relay node accelerated vesting
On Sep. 30th, 2019, relay nodes voted in favor of delaying their ALGO payouts, which would allow Algorand and relay node operators to discuss potential modifications to the rewards schedule. Algorand investors USV and Pillar offered support for a new, elongated vesting schedule since the ALGO supply growth at the time was ""too large relative to the state of adoption."" Relay nodes opted to delay their ALGO rewards twice more until the network passed EIP-11252019AF, which extended the vesting plan from two years to five years, meaning payouts would complete by the end of 2024. But this new schedule rewarded relay nodes by increasing their share of the ALGO supply by 25% and offered an accelerated vesting schedule should the price of ALGO reach specific targets.

Unvested tokens dedicated to relay nodes will now vest according to the following guaranteed base vesting schedule:
Year 1 (2020) 3% (for a total of 17%, as relay nodes had already received 14% of their total share at this point)
Year 2 (2021), 8% (for a total of 25%)
Year 3 (2022), 25% (for a total of 50%)
Year 4 (2023), 35% (for a total of 85%)
Year 5 (2024), 40% (for a total of 125%)

Although this schedule can accelerate depending on the 30-day moving average of AGLO price, Algorand used the base vesting schedule to determine the supply curve.",Fixed Supply,Premined Rewards,True,9979490657.0,,Proof-of-Stake,Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS),4.3,,,,False,,The Algorand Foundation’s Economic and Technical Advisory Committees are assisting with the launch stages and initial governance of the public Algorand blockchain. The foundation is a research and governance organization committed to encouraging continued development and innovation on the Algorand network. The long-term vision is to transition to a governance structure equipped with a constitution and designed for community involvement.,Upcoming,"Algorand also features a consensus-based approach to protocol update proposals. Community members can post code changes on the network, and stakeholders can use the Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus model to vote on whether to accept or reject the changes. Users are given the additional ability to reach a consensus on the parameters following a given outcome. For instance, if a proposal is accepted, community members collectively determine which block the update to implement. Any user can participate in Algorand’s governance system.

At the moment, the Algorand team constructs and releases protocol upgrades. But as described in the consensus-based approach above, node operators ultimately determine whether to accept or reject the code changes. Once Algorand releases a protocol upgrade, at least 90% of network nodes must approve the change (done simply by upgrading their node) before the code changes are considered active (i.e., are accessible to users and developers). If approved, the remaining network nodes have a grace period of 140,000 blocks (about seven days) to complete the upgrade before being ""kicked-off"" (unable to sync with) the network. This ""upgrade-required window"" recently increased from 10,000 blocks to 140,000 blocks with the activation of Algorand v2.0.2",False,,

As such, it went through two halvings to date; in November 2012, and again in July 2016, each cutting the initial block reward by half. On average, Bitcoin Cash generates new blocks every 10 minutes, rewarding miners with 12.5 new BCH and the total transaction fees from the preceding block. Each block has a 32MB limit and block rewards are <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/halving"">halved </a>every 210,000 blocks (approximately 4 years). Eventually, once the 21 million BCH hard cap has been reached, block rewards will transition entirely to transaction fees shifting the security model of the protocol to one based on demand for block space versus one based on demand for BCH. Bitcoin Cash's next halving is expected to happen in May 2020.

The difference between BCH and BTC supply curves since the fork can be explained by the difficulty adjustment algorithm which included one addition compared to Bitcoin: the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA). This mechanism was set by the Bitcoin Cash developers to incentivize miners to prioritize BCH’s transactions over that of BTC’s. Miners leveraged this mechanism to maximize their profit by reducing their BCH mining output while waiting for the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment to reduce BCH’s difﬁculty, which in turn would lead to higher returns. As a result, 120,000 more BCH than BTC were mined from August 01, 2017, until November 13, 2017, when Bitcoin Cash underwent a hard fork to change the difficulty adjustment algorithm.

Consensus in Bitcoin Cash, and other systems using Nakamoto Conensus, is probabilistic because there is always a chance that a new, longer competing chain could emerge with more accumulated proof-of-work, that would invalidate the current chain.

Mining

Miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks using a <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/sha-256"">SHA-256</a> algorithm. In this process, miners compete to generate a <a href=""https://messari.io/blog/hash-function"">hash</a> less than the target number set by Bitcoin Cash's <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level"">difficulty adjustment algorithm</a>. Notably, the target difficulty level is adjusted every block as opposed to Bitcoin's every 2016 blocks.

Although open to anyone with a CPU, Bitcoin Cash mining is now dominated by <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics"">ASICs</a> usually situated in enterprise-scale data centers. Furthermore, in order to smooth individual miner revenue as mining has become more competitive, mining is now done in pools where participants contribute <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/hash-power"">hash power</a> to the pool and receive a proportional share of the profits if the pool finds a valid block.",Proof-of-Work,Nakamoto Consensus,600.0,6.25,SHA-256,2024-04-01T04:00:00Z,True,,"Bitcoin Cash developement is open to the open-source community.

",Inflationary,Dynamic Emission,False,,"Cosmos is designed to operate as a network of zones and hubs. Zones are application-specific blockchains with sovereign security and governance models while hubs are intermediary blockchains that observe the state of connected zones and facilitate asset transfer between them. Cosmos is not a blockchain but a toolbox to design new blockchains. However, Cosmos Hub is the first PoS blockchain that works as a hub between zones and contains a multi-asset ledger, and lets other subsequent zones interact with each other through the inter-blockchain communication protocol, IBC. Their interaction is powered by Tendermint Core, a secure consensus protocol that provides fast finality and is easily adaptable with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain. Interacting with the IBC protocol requires chains to have a consensus mechanism that offers fast finality, meaning that Cosmos cannot use IBC for asset transfers between proof-of-work blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin. In order to bypass this shortcoming, Cosmos introduces account-based blockchains called peg zones (Peggy) and offers fast finality through implementing finality thresholds to blockchains with probabilistic finality.",Delegated Proof-of-Stake,Tendermint Consensus Mechanism,6.0,,,,False,,"

All the zones in the Cosmos network have distinct governance styles tailored for the value proposition of the blockchain. The Cosmos Hub, on the other hand, employs a hybrid governance model where it uses an off-chain governance platform for discussions and uses on-chain voting for decision-making and execution. Any user can submit proposals on protocol upgrades, modifications to network parameters, bounty allocations, and other governance policies and participate in discussions on the Cosmos governance forum. Since community governance plays an essential role in the development and stability of the network, Cosmos Hub obliges each validator to vote on every proposal. Those who do not vote, get penalized by the protocol and their validator status gets deactivated for a predetermined period of time. The Cosmos Hub also benefits from an additional aiding agent named Governance Working Group which aims to equip Cosmos governance with structural tools, improve governance functionality, and conduct educational efforts to further the awareness and the adoption of Cosmos governance.",Delegated On-Chain Vote,"Proposals go through four different phases before either being accepted and executed or rejected.

__Phase 1: The Deposit Period__ 
Anyone can submit a text proposal to the system, but the proposal needs to be backed with a minimum deposit of [64 ATOM](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/47)s within two weeks after the submission date to proceed into the voting phase.  This requirement is a protective measure against proposal spamming.  The party submitting the proposal does not necessarily need to provide the deposit themselves, or in other words, any ATOM holder can contribute to this deposit to support the proposal. Contributors can reclaim their tokens once the proposal gets accepted or if it fails to reach the minimum threshold after two weeks.

__Phase 2: The Voting Period__ 
The deposit period ends once the proposal reaches the minimum deposit amount and a two-week-long voting period begins. There are four voting options (“Yes”, “No”, “No with Veto”, “Abstain”). During the voting process;
- Only staked (bonded) tokens can participate in governance.
- Voting power is measured in terms of stake. The amount of ATOMs staked determines the direct influence of the user on the decision-making process (coin voting).
- Delegators inherit the vote of the validators they are delegated to unless they individually cast their vote, which will overwrite validator decisions.
__Phase 3: Tallying Results__ 
Following requirements need to be satisfied for a proposal to get a passing vote:
- __Quorum__: More than 40% of the total staked tokens need to have participated in the vote.
- __Threshold__: More than 50% of the tokens that participated in the vote (after excluding “Abstain” votes) need to have voted in favor of the proposal (“Yes”).
- __Veto__: The number of votes cast for ""No with Veto"" shouldn't be greater than 33.4% of the tokens that participated (after excluding “Abstain” votes).
The proposal gets rejected if one of these requirements is not met at the end of the voting period. And if a proposal fails to pass the vote for any reason, the deposited tokens associated with the submission are not refunded and instead transferred to the community pool.

__Phase 4: Implementing the Proposal__ 
Accepted proposals regarding protocol upgrades and network parameter modifications are integrated with a new version of Cosmos.

Stellar initially stated that the 100 billion XLM issued at the launch of the network in 2015 would be distributed as follows: 
50% would be reserved for the Direct Sign-up Program. The goal of the Direct Sign-up Program was ""to make lumens easily accessible to millions of individuals and communities across the globe"" through airdrops.
20% would be allocated to the Bitcoin Program. The goal of the Bitcoin Program was ""to encourage bitcoin holders to explore and use Stellar"" by airdropping tokens to Bitcoin addresses. 
25% would be distributed as part of the Partnership Program. The goal of the Partnership Program was ""to encourage adoption and growth of Stellar through the institutional distribution of lumens"" by distributing grants to businesses, governments, institutions, or nonprofit organizations.
2% would be allocated to Stripe for its seed investment and locked until June 2019.
3% would be retained by the Stellar Development Foundation for its operational budget

The Direct Sign-up, Bitcoin and Partnership Program featured an initial distribution plan over a period of 10 years. Nevertheless, the SDF did not manage to distribute those XLM as expected and conducted several changes to its distribution plan and treasury management over the years, as detailed in the Supply Curve details section.

Nevertheless, those distribution mechanisms initially designed by the SDF proved hard to effectively execute:
Out of the 20 billion XLM to be distributed to Bitcoin holders (19 billion) and XRP holders (1 billion), only 2.037 billion were distributed in two rounds, in October 2016 and August 2017. The rest (17.963 billion) was re-allocated to the SDF operational budget in 2017. As such, the SDF increased its operational budget, initially set at 3 billion XLM by 600% through this re-allocation. 
Out of the 50 billion XLM to be distributed through the Direct Sign-up program, the SDF only managed to effectively distribute 4.2 billion XLM, less than 10% of what was originally planned. 
Out of the 25 billion XLM to be distributed through the Partnership program, the SDF only managed to effectively distribute 1.138 billion XLM, less than 5% of what was originally planned. It's also interesting to note that the address that received this 1.138 billion XLM sent then back to the SDF-managed address in November 2019, right before the SDF burnt 55 billion XLM, as detailed below. 

Globally, the SDF only managed to distribute 7.375 billion XLM through these three programs, instead of the 95 billion initially scheduled. 

Built-in Inflation Mechanism

Until October 2019, the Stellar ledger also featured a built-in, fixed, nominal inflation mechanism. New Lumens were added to the network at a rate of 1% each year. Each week, the protocol would distribute these Lumens to any account that receives over 0.05% of the “votes” from other accounts in the network.  Given the very high supply concentration within the SDF treasury addresses due to the inefficiency of the distribution mechanisms, the SDF would receive over 95% of the votes, and thus 95% of the built-in inflation, increasing its operational budget by more than 4 billion XLM thanks to this built-in inflation mechanism. In October 2019 Stellar removed the 1% annual issuance rate from the Stellar protocol stating that it was not benefiting the projects building on Stellar.

2017 Inflation Exploit

From January to April 2017, Stellar suffered a serious inflation bug, <a href=""https://messari.io/c/research/stellar-s-2017-inflation-exploit"">discovered in 2019 by Messari</a>. The bug was exploited, significantly inflationary, and patched with little publicity in April 2017. The attacker was able to create over 2.2 billion Lumens worth nearly $10 million at the time. Once it discovered and patched the bug, the SDF destroyed the equivalent number of coins that were created through the bug. Nevertheless, the XLM burned to offset the inflation bug came from the Direct Sing-up program allocation. As such, the SDF burnt supply that was meant to be distributed to the crowd to offset an inflation bug that was exploited by an attacker.

Overhang burning

Conscious of the difficulty the distribute this important supply overhang, the SDF decided to burn more than 55 billion XLM in November 2019.
37.6 billion XLM were burned from the Direct Sign-up Program allocation, reducing the supply left to be distributed to 4 billion XLM. As a result, instead of distributing 50 billion XLM through the Direct Sign-up program, the SDF will only distribute a maximum of 8.2 billion XLM (4.2 billion distributed from 2015 to 2019 and 4 billion left to be distributed). 
12.988 billion XLM were burned from the Partnership program, reducing the supply left to be distributed to 8 billion XLM. As a result, instead of distribution 25 billion XLM through the Partnership program, the SDF will only distribute a maximum of 8 billion XLM. 
4.88 billion XLM were burned from the SDF operational budget. Nevertheless, this burn only offset the newly issued XLM received through the built-in inflation during the first 5 years of the protocol. 

Through this burn, the SDF reduced the maximum supply from 105 billion XLM to 50 billion XLM. ",Fixed Supply,Premined Rewards,True,50001806811.6,"Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) is a modified version of Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA). In an FBA system, there are quorums and quorum slices. Quorum is a set of nodes sufficient to reach agreement. Given that an FBA system is open participation, meaning that participants can join and leave as they please, it is impossible for the system to know how many nodes are sufficient for quorum without knowing the identities and amounts of nodes in the system. Thus, FBA introduces a concept of quorum slices nodes. A quorum slice is a subset of a quorum that can convince one particular node about agreement. In an FBA system nodes broadcast and individually determine which quorums slices to trust, and build their own quorum based on the information they have at hand. In FBA systems it is crucial that these quoroms overlap to ensure the network reaches consensus. Ripple for example, provides a list of trusted validators to use in order ensure there is overlap when participating in the Ripple Consensus Protocol (RCP). 

Consensus in FBA systems is reached through a multi round process where validators share ledger candidates between each other, adding and subtracting transactions until their candidate proposals match what their validators in their quorom slice proposed. Once a supermajority is reached, each server independently computes a new ledger hash from the agreed-upon set of transactions and compares results. Once a super majority of validators agree upon the hash of the new ledger candidate, the ledger candidate is considered final.

SCP differentiates itself from RCP in that validators can choose their own quorom slices rather than using a pre-defined one (from Ripple). Furthermore, rather than relying on a super majority of nodes for consensus SCP introduces notions of validator quality, where validators are weighted based on trustworthiness and reliability, and validator grouping, where validators are grouped by organization. SCP posit these additions allow for stronger quorums.
",Other,Stellar Consensus Protocol,4.0,,,,False,,"Stellar is an open source source protocol whereby anyone can review and contribute to the development of Stellar's core code. New changes or standards start as proposals divided into two categories: Core Advancement Proposals and Stellar Ecosystem Proposals. Core Advancement Proposals (CAPs) are suggested changes to the core protocol of Stellar. Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs) deal with changes to the standards, protocols, and methods used in the ecosystem built on top of the Stellar network. Ultimately protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when they are accepted by a majority of the network validators. 

Nevertheless, despite independent contribution to the project through CAPs and SEPs, a full-time team at the SDF performs the majority of protocol and ecosystem development. The SDF sets the project roadmap, acts as a steward of the Stellar network, and builds constructive relationships with governments and financial institutions worldwide. The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) is a non-profit dedicated to supporting the growth and development of Stellar. SDF was created in collaboration with Stripe, which provided $3 million in seed funding, and is financed by Stellar Lumens. SDF has three boards: the Board of Directors, responsible for governance decisions and XLM distribution; the Architecture Board, responsible for technical initiatives; and the Expansion Board, responsible for ecosystem growth and regulatory issues.

Consensus in Monero, and other systems using Nakamoto Conensus, is probabilistic because there is always a chance that a new, longer competing chain could emerge with more accumulated proof-of-work, that would invalidate the current chain.

Mining
Miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks using the RandomX proof-of-work algorithm. In this process, miners compete to generate a <a href=""https://messari.io/blog/hash-function"">hash</a> less than the target number set by Monero's <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level"">difficulty adjustment algorithm</a>. The target difficulty level is adjusted every block.

In the pursuit of decentralization at the miner level, Monero periodically changes its proof-of-work algorithm via hard forks to ensure Monero remains ASIC resistant and open to individuals with commodity hardware. Like many proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, mining is now done in pools where participants contribute <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/hash-power"">hash power</a> to the pool and receive a proportional share of the profits if the pool finds a valid block. This is to smooth individuals' mining revenue as mining has become more competitive. 

Block sizes in Monero are dynamic and there is no preset block size limit like there is in Bitcoin. However, despite there being no block size limits, Monero has a block reward penalty system that keeps block sizes in check. The block reward penalty system works first by taking the median size of the last 100 blocks. If a new block's size is greater than that median, then the block reward gets reduced quadratically depending on how much the new block size exceeds that median. The maximum block size is set at two times the median of the last 100 blocks, and as the block size approaches that limit the block reward approaches zero. ",Proof-of-Work,Nakamoto Consensus,120.0,,RandomX,,False,,"Monero protocol development involves a proposal process whereby anyone in the open source Monero community can submit proposals for improving the Monero protocol. After debate by the community, when consensus has emerged, the Monero Core maintainers merge code changes into Monero Core's GitHub Repository.

The FFS is a system whereby anyone can propose ideas and request anonymous donations to fund development work.

These qualities aim to give ETC store of value (SoV) propoerties. This asset also serves as a reward to miners for contributing resources to the network.",Crowdsale,"The Pre-Mine
Ethereum Classic's token distribution follows that of Ethereum, as the two chains have a shared history. Before the eventual split sparked by The DAO incident, ETH and ETC were the same asset (originally known as ETH).

The original distribution event occurred through a public token sale managed by the <a href=""https://messari.io/asset/ethereum"">Ethereum Foundation</a>, which sold roughly 60 million ETH (80% of the initial 72 million ETH supply). The sale took place between Jul. 22, 2014, and Sep. 2, 2014. The remaining 12 million ETH (20% of the initial supply) were allocated to the Foundation and early contributors. Of the ether sent to the Foundation:
3 million were allocated to a long-term endowment
6 million were distributed among 85 developers who contributed prior to the crowdsale
3 million were designed as a “developer purchase program” that gave Ethereum developers the rights to purchase ETC at crowdsale prices.

All other ETH (and now ETC) issuance that took place occurred through the process of Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining.

The Fork Distribution
When Ethereum and Ethereum Classic split following the DAO fork (on July 20, 2016), anyone who held ETH now owned equivalent amounts of ETH and ETC. When a contentious hard fork occurs, users of the original chain can claim the native asset issued on the new chain, if different. Since the Ethereum Foundation trademarked the name ""Ethereum"" and the ""ETH"" ticker, the legacy chain opted to rebrand itself to ""Ethereum Classic"" and use the ticker ""ETC"" for its native asset.","[{'title': 'Initial Coin Offering (ICO)', 'start_date': '2014-07-22T04:00:00Z', 'type': 'Token Sale', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2014-09-02T04:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 576000000, 'asset_collected': 'BTC', 'price_per_token_in_asset': 0.00057227, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.31, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 31725.91842569, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 18300000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': []}]",[],"[{'account_type': 'Community Fund', 'asset_held': {'id': 'ETC', 'name': 'Ethereum Classic'}, 'addresses': [{'name': 'Community Fund', 'link': 'https://blockscout.com/etc/mainnet/address/0x48dbDa9443746A99eF1b26aB01DD94aC50D7014b/transactions'}], 'security': 'Multi-Sig'}, {'account_type': 'ETC Cooperative Donations', 'asset_held': {'id': 'ETC', 'name': 'Ethereum Classic'}, 'addresses': [{'name': 'Donations', 'link': 'https://blockscout.com/etc/mainnet/address/0x217Db77248a60F1f4e3Ab31c6e8Fb7ab0C05cf53/transactions'}], 'security': None}]",,[],72003680.24,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': 83.47, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': 16.53, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': None}",,2015-07-30T08:00:00Z,"When Ethereum Classic and Ethereum went there separate ways on July 20, 2016, anyone who owned ETH received an equal amount of ETC via a hard fork airdrop.

ECIP-1017 activated on December 11, 2017. The proposal introduced a disinflationary token issuance policy, in which the block reward is reduced by 20% every five million blocks, and stated the total supply would not exceed 210.7 million ETC.

On May 29, 2018, the Ethereum Classic community accepted ECIP-1041, effectively diffusing the Difficulty Bomb.

Ethereum Classic underwent its second block reward reduction on <a href=""https://messari.io/article/ethereum-classic-to-undergo-block-reward-reduction-amid-market-uncertainty"">Mar. 16, 2020</a>, dropping reward per block from 4 to 3.2 ETH. Per ECIP-1017 specifications, the reward will be reduced to 2.56 ETC at block 15,000,000 (expected to arrive on Apr. 15, 2022).",Inflationary,Decreasing Issuance,True,210700000.0,"Modified GHOST protocol
The Ethereum White Paper states Ethereum, thus Ethereum Classic uses a modified version of the ""Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree"" (GHOST) protocol to distinguish the ""longest"" base chain (the chain with the most accumulated Proof-of-Work backing it) from forks. <a href=""https://messari.io/article/nakamoto-consensus"">Nakamoto Consensus</a>, the implementation used by Bitcoin (<a href=""https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin"">$BTC</a>) and its forks, is problematic in networks with fast confirmation times (i.e., block times) like Ethereum Classic. Quick block times lead to a higher stale or orphan rate, which can split mining resources among competing forks and reduce overall network security. Accelerated confirmation times also increases the likelihood a single <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/mining"">mining</a> pool could obtain a majority of the <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/hash-power"">hash power</a> on a given chain.

The GHOST protocol attempts to solve this issue of network security by including <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/orphan-block"">orphan blocks</a> in the calculation of the longest chain. Therefore, the GHOST model determines the valid chain byweighingthe parent and further ancestors as well as the number of stale descendants. The protocol also rewards the mining of orphan blocks directly connected to the longest chain to combat potential centralization concerns. Orphan block miners do not receive any transaction fees, only a portion of the block subsidy, as stale transactions are not considered valid.

Mining
Ethereum Classic miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks by running the Ethash <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work"">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a> algorithm. In this process, miners compete to discover a valid hash as defined by the network's <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level"">difficulty adjustment</a> algorithm. Ethereum Classic recalculates its difficulty level every block based on the time between the two previous blocks.

Cryptographers designed Ethash to be <a href=""https://messari.io/blog/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics"">ASIC</a>-resistant by making it memory intensive for specialized mining chips. But the popularity of Ethereum led mining chip manufacturer Bitmain to release the first ASICs miners for Ethash in April 2018. Since Ethereum and Ethereum Classic share the same mining algorithm at the moment, ASIC miners on Ethereum can shift their hash power over to Ethereum Classic to mine ETC. This opportunity combined with lower security spend on Ethereum Classic likely led to the various <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/51-attack"">51% attacks</a> registered on Ethereum Classic, the first of which occurred in Jan. 2019 followed by three more in Aug. 2020.

ETC Nodes (Ethereum Classic Node Tracker",Proof-of-Work,,15.0,4.0,Ethash,2022-04-15T00:00:00Z,True,,"All network changes are subject to the improvement proposal or ECIP process, which is a standardized model for proposing changes to the Ethereum Classic ecosystem. In this model, anyone can submit code changes, dubbed Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals (ECIP), that aim to either modify the core protocol or even the ECIP process itself. The ECIP process takes after the EIP and BIP systems used in Ethereum and Bitcoin, respectively.

Once the author submits a proposal, they must champion it to be successful, which consists of the author making themselves available to answer any questions from network stakeholders. Proposals must also pass through several stages before being implemented into node client software.

Proposals begin in the “Draft Stage,” and if successful, make their way to the “Accepted Stage.” Submissions must pass each stage by a rough consensus. Client developers may add the submitted changes to their clients at their discretion. There are no on-chain voting mechanisms Ethereum Classic relies on to make changes.

Network Security via Staking: A node's influence towards the determination of consensus timestamp and order is weighted by the number of HBARs the node itself has in its account and (to be implemented at a future date) the number of HBARs that other non-node accounts proxy to that node.
Incentivizing Security (Staking Rewards): Nodes (and those that proxy their HBARs to nodes) will receive daily reward payments as per the participation in validating transactions during that period.",Private Sale,"Initial Allocations
Hedera network has a total fixed supply of 50 billion HBAR, which were minted at the network launch on Aug. 24, 2018. Before the Hedera network opened to the public, 6.7 million HBAR were set aside for the community testing program, while the rest remained in the Hedera Treasury account. When the network opened access to the public on Sept. 16, 2019, 45.09% of the total 50 billion HBAR were allocated to early management, employees (current and future), SAFTs (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) investors, advisors, community earn programs, and enterprise and developer grants. The rest (54.91%) remained in the Hedera Treasury.

Private SAFTs
Hedera issued three SAFTs, with the first SAFT being offered in December 2017 and the final SAFT round closing in August 2018. In the aggregate, 17.45% of all HBAR were sold in these private rounds. Hedera’s co-founders and early executives also acquired tokens through a SAFT as part of their compensation. Dr. Baird and Mr. Harmon (“The Founders”) each have a coin grant of two billion HBAR in total allocation (4% of total supply), each vesting over six years. Other senior executives who joined Hedera prior to March 2018 received an aggregate of 3.5% of the total coin supply via SAFTs and coin grants.

Additional Allocations
Hedera compensated employees, advisors, vendors, and other service providers in the form of Restricted Coin Units (RCUs), whereby individuals vest into a right to receive a select amount of HBAR. Hedera created a reserve of 8.1 billion HBAR for the coin plan that covers RCUs.

Hedera issued Swirlds (which owns patents on the hashgraph technology) a one-time allocation of 5% of the total supply of HBAR and allocated 1.24 billion tokens to the developer community and ecosystem reserve funds.

No more than 34% of the total HBAR is expected to be released until 2025.

Hedera will remain a permissioned network until the total value of all the circulating HBAR is high enough to be prohibitively expensive for a malicious user (or group of users) to acquire enough tokens to conduct an attack.","[{'title': 'SAFT Series 1', 'start_date': '2017-12-01T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Token Sale', 'details': 'SAFT Series 1 was offered to employees, other early contributors and advisors, friends, and family in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “*Securities Act*”).

The Hashgraph consensus algorithm is Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (ABFT). Every node participates in every round of consensus, meaning it doesn't rely on a single node or ""leader"" to order transactions each round. The consensus is ''fair in that it doesn’t allow a leader to censor or unduly delay a given transaction.

In addition to ordering transactions, Hashgraph also issues a consensus timestamp for each transaction, calculated as the time at which the transaction reached a majority of the network. Once the consensus timestamp is determined then the transaction is final, which contrasts most Proof-of-Work (PoW) networks that rely on probabilistic finality. A formal proof of the consensus algorithm is available here. Hedera's fee model is not auction-based, a common model among most networks for submitting transactions. Without the concept of a fee auction, users can't pay more in fees to increase the likelihood of their transactions being ordered before transactions that may have been submitted earlier.

Hashgraph aims to process a high number of transactions per second (TPS) with low latency. The team has said Hedera's hashgraph consensus allows it to support over 10,000 transactions per second. The nature of these transactions has been disputed, as the 10,000 number may only represent cryptocurrency transactions and not any smart contract interactions. These disputes can be found here and here, while the Hedera team has issued a few rebuttals here and here.

As for how Hedera achieves this reportedly high TPS, it leverages two core components within Hashgraph: gossip about gossip and virtual voting. These components, along with weighting votes by stake, enable nodes to determine the consensus order of transactions. More information can be found here.",Proof-of-Stake,Hashgraph,,,,,False,,"Hedera is owned and governed by the Hedera Governing Council, which consists of up to 39 term-limited organizations and enterprises. Council members are committed to running consensus nodes and governing software changes.

Each member of the Hedera Governing Council has an equal vote when deciding whether to accept an improvement proposal or change to the Hedera platform’s codebase. All members have a three-year maximum term, with up to two consecutive terms. Swirlds, the creator of the hashgraph algorithm, has a permanent seat and equal vote. After initial members are selected by Swirlds, the council’s Membership Committee will source replacements.

The Hedera network separates governance from consensus. The governance model is more traditional, using a model pioneered by National BankAmericard Inc. (now VISA) in 1968. It is designed in a way to incentivize the governing council to do what’s in the best interest of the Hedera network and discourage a single company from assuming total control. It also aims to prevent the Hedera Governing Council from being unduly influenced by individual members or node operators.

Token holders can use FIL to participate and transact in the Filecoin network. In particular, users pay miners in FIL to store or distribute data and to retrieve their information. Storage providers also post FIL as collateral to provide a minimum level of guarantee of their service, which gets slashed should a deal with a customer fall through. ","Crowdsale, Private Sale","Within a short timespan in 2017, Filecoin raised $52 million in an advisor pre-sale followed by a $153 million public offering through token sale platform CoinList. It raised these funds using a relatively new method known as a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT). The SAFT is a legal agreement inspired by the Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE), pioneered by Y Combinator. It gives accredited investors an allocation of tokens once the network is live in return for an upfront investment.

Of the $205 million raised, $52 million was sold to advisors at a rate of $0.75 per FIL token, with an additional discount of between 0% and 30%. Vesting for advisors ranged from one to three years. The remaining $153 million was raised from investors with FIL tokens priced based on a linearly increasing function. The starting price for the sale was $1.00 per FIL and increased up to $5.00 per FIL using the formula (price = $ amount raised / 40 million), with a hard cap of 200 million FIL sold.  Investor tokens, from the advisor and token sale rounds, will vest on variable periods with a six-month minimum.

FIL has a max supply of two billion, of which 600 million were pre-allocated at genesis according to the following allocations (percentages based on max supply):
10.5% was allocated to Protocol Labs with a 6-year linear vesting
4.5% was allocated to Protocol Labs team member and contributors with a 6-year linear vesting
7.5% was allocated to 2017 SAFT investors with a 6-month to 3-year linear vesting
2.5% was allocated to future fundraising or ecosystem development
5% was allocated to the Filecoin Foundation with a 6-year linear vesting

The remaining 70% of the total supply is allocated to Filecoin miners and will be released over time to reward providing data storage service, maintaining the blockchain, distributing data, and running applications.","[{'title': 'Advisor Pre-Sale', 'start_date': '2017-07-24T04:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private', 'details': 'Filecoin offered a FIL pre-sale to a group of advisors labeled as ""individuals and organizations who have helped to build the Filecoin network, who have made strong long-term commitments for the future, and/or who present very significant future opportunities for the network.""

The Filecoin protocol intends to use Proof-of-Replication (PoRep) and Proof-of-Spacetime (PoSt) to prove files are stored securely over time within a decentralized network.
PoRep is a type of Proof-of-Storage featuring the specific properties that outlined in this post
PoSt defines the mechanism by which miners create blocks that are storing data. Clients (network users) can source miners of data storage and data retrieval, different operations that existing within separate decentralized markets. PoSt provides a level of verifiability so that data can be stored and retrieved in a distributed, multi-market system.

Mining
Storage miners can earn FIL by storing data for clients and ""computing cryptographic proofs to verify storage across time."" Unlike Proof-of-Work mining, the probability of earning a block reward (and transaction fees) is ""proportional to the amount of storage the miner contributes to the network.""

On the other hand, retrieval miners can receive FIL by winning bids for a client request. The market value of the file in question determines the miner's payout. Available bandwidth and initial response time for details (which could be influenced by network latency or proximity to a client) impact a miner's ability to close deals and retrieve data on the network. Therefore, the ""maximum bandwidth of a retrieval miner will set the total quantity of deals"" they can win.

With the network still in development, the mining equipment specifications (specifically for CPU and RAM) remain unknown. But the team insists the mining hardware will contain configurations with many standard hard drives and that any “specialized Filecoin mining hardware” will not exceed anything more than a highly optimized hard drive (in a sense, not optimal for ASICs). Filecoin also notes note that early storage and retrieval miners will be required to run full nodes.

The foundation is Protocol Lab's solution for the long-term governance and support of the Filecoin protocol. Protocol Labs has not released any other details on the Filcoin Foundation to date, but the foundation will remain inactive until the network launches. This foundation will receive 5% of the FIL tokens created at genesis to help fund future initiatives.",No On-Chain Governance,,,,

Users who cannot meet this threshold can combine votes with other community members and collectively submit their desired proposal.

On-chain voting is held on Frax's Snapshot and has a minimum duration of three days. 5000 FXS is the minimum voting power to start a valid voting process on Snapshot. At the end of the voting process, a simple majority will win the vote for or against the implementation of the proposal. Finally, a quorum of 10% of FXS circulating supply must validate the final vote on meta-governance and FXS emission proposals. All other proposals have a quorum requirement of 5%.

It is the ERC-20 token that will be used all across The Sandbox metaverse. 

$SAND is a primary asset of The Sandbox platform and serves a few purposes including:

Medium of exchange: Players can potentially collect SAND through gameplay, and subsequently spend $SAND to play games, purchase equipment, or customize Avatar characters. Creators can spend SAND to acquire ASSETS and LAND. Artists can spend SAND to upload ASSETS to the Marketplace and buy GEMs for defining item rarity.
Governance: $SAND allows holders to participate in governance decisions. SAND owners can vote themselves or delegate voting rights to other players of their choice.
Staking: Users can stake $SAND tokens to earn rewards, as well as GEMs and CATALYSTs for ASSETS creation.

The Sandbox also utilizes the ERC-721 non-fungible token standard for its LAND – digital land – assets (read the technology section to find out more about The Sandbox's other ecosystem tokens).

In Tezos, a participant needs to have a minimum stake of 8,000 XTZ to be considered a baker. The <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-stake"">Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</a> consensus mechanism selects bakers as a function of their total stake to participant in signing the next block of transactions. Stakeholders that do not have enough XTZ or the technical wherewithal to set up the required infrastructure can also use delegation to participate in consensus.

Participants in the consensus algorithm are called delegates, and these contributors can assume one of two roles:
a baker: a delegate that creates blocks
an endorser: a delegate that contributes in agreeing on a block by endorsing that block
Baking rights and endorsing rights are determined at the beginning of a cycle (i.e., a chunk of blocks) by computing a random seed from information already found on the blockchain. Bakers and endorsers receive rewards (in the form of XTZ inflation or newly minted tokens) for their contributions to incentivize consensus participation. The delegation process transcends traditional PoS models as anyone is free to participate as well as select and govern the validator of their choice to offload any infrastructure management or costs.

Implicit vs. originated accounts
Originated accounts are contracts that can delegate funds to other accounts to participate in the baking process. Implicit accounts cannot delegate; instead, they can be registered as bakers and receive delegate funds (and voting power) Once registered, an implicit account can participate in baking with its own balance plus any funds delegated from originated accounts.",Proof-of-Stake,Liquid Proof-of-Stake,60.0,16.0,,,False,,"The Tezos Foundation manages the allocation of the funds collected during Tezos’ <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/initial-coin-offering-ico"">initial coin offering (ICO)</a>.

The primary reason for fixing the Theta token supply is to make it prohibitively expensive for a malicious actor to acquire enough tokens to threaten the network. Since new Theta tokens will never be created, the only way to acquire more is by purchasing existing tokens and over time making it more expensive to amass a controlling amount of Theta tokens.

The Theta team stated that it takes a multi-step approach of gradually transitioning governance responsibilities to all stakeholders of the network. The composition of the validator set will transition over time to the community of relay nodes, video platforms, and other strategic partners.

Currently Theta must be assumed to be in control of all Enterprise Validator nodes.

The project opted to distribute these assets through a few tokens sales, a reward mechanism for providing liquidity, and direct allocations to early contributors. THORChain also has an incentive model for node operators, whereby these participants can earn rewards from a pool of pre-minted tokens once the network launches.

In Oct. 2019, THORChain opted to burn all of the ""unused"" reserve RUNE, which when combined with the ~15 million tokens burned through Project Surtr, amounted to 50% of the initial max supply. The supply reduction did not impact the tokens already distributed to Pre-Sale and Initial DEX Offering (IDO) investors.

Operational reserves (THORChain company): 130 million (65 million post-burn) to use for Staff incentives, other sales, and liquidity bootstrapping
Community reserves (RUNEVault): 120 million (now 60 million)

Seed investors: 60 million (now 30 million)
Pre-Sale (Private Sale) investors: 70 million
Initial DEX Offering (IDO): 7 million (of the 20 million offered in the sale, 13 million went unsold and were later burned)

Token sales
THORChain kicked off RUNE distribution through what it called an Initial DEX Offering (IDO). The sale ran on Binance DEX, a decentralized exchange launched by Binance on its blockchain network (aptly named Binance Chain). THORChain sold 7 million RUNE (out of a proposed 20 million) during the IDO at an average price of  $0.032, raising $224,000 worth of BNB in the process.

The project also completed a Seed round and a pre-sale before launching its IDO. The Seed round distributed 60 million RUNE priced at $0.01, while the pre-sale sold 70 million tokens at a 30% max discount compared to the IDO price (which was about $0.023).

Community reserves (RUNEVault): 60 million (initially 120 million) emitted over 2.5 years through the RUNEVault rewards program and airdrop events
Team & Advisors: 50 million (initially 100 million), which are locked until mainnet launch, then released in 20% batches every three months
Seed investors: 30 million (initially 60 million), of which four million were distributed immediately. The rest of the tokens will remain locked until mainnet launch, then released in 20% batches every three months
Pre-Sale (Private Sale) investors: 70 million. 50% of this pool was unlocked upon distribution to provide enough liquidity on Binance DEX. The other half unlocked one week after the close of THORChain's initial DEX offering (IDO).
Initial DEX Offering (IDO): 20 million, of which 13 million went unsold and were later burned, that came with no vesting schedule

Ongoing emissions
THORChain includes a few ongoing emission models to incentivize network participation:
RUNEVault issues two million RUNE tokens each month as part of its staking rewards program. This issuance will continue until the Community reserves (60 million total tokens) runs out, which would allow the RUNEVault program to operate for about 2.5 years after its launch. Note that THORChain could revisit this model in the future with community input to reduce reserve emission.
Service nodes and liquidity provisioners will receive monthly distributions equal to the below block rewards calculation. Two-thirds of this block reward will go to service nodes (aka validators), and the remaining third will go towards liquidity incentives. Block rewards will continue until this bucket's max supply of 220,447,472 RUNE is reached.
blockRewardsPerMonth = maxSupply - circulatingSupply) / (6 * 12)

Project Surtr (The RUNE burn program)
THORChain introduced Project Sutr in Aug. 2019, which aims to burn any unused RUNE from the various token reserves. On the 20th of every month, the team gathers input from the community to determine whether unallocated RUNE should be burned. Our Liquid Supply Curve does not include tokens removed through the burn program, as the total burned each month is unpredictable.",Fixed Supply,Premined Rewards,True,500000000.0,,Proof-of-Stake,,5.0,,,,,,"While the protocol remains in its early stages, the THORChain team will manage software releases and network changes, albeit it with community feedback. But the project eventually plans to transition to an on-chain governance system, which it calls the Æsir protocol.",Upcoming,"Once THORChain launches and achieves a certain level of stability, the project intends to transition to an [on-chain governance system](https://github.com/thorchain/Resources/blob/master/Whitepapers/AEsir-Protocol/whitepaper-en.md) known as the *Æ*sir protocol. It aims to include and empower the three main network participants: Validators, Standby Validators, and Delegators.

The voting and delegation model is similar to systems seen in Tezos or Cosmos. THORChain validators can accept delegations from any RUNE token holder, thus boosting their overall stake and voting power. But block rewards get evenly distributed among validators, incentivizing delegators to seek out validators with a lower stake weight. The design aims to minimize voting power centralization at the top of the Validator Set (i.e., the top 100 validators). Prospective validators that exist outside of the top 100 are known are Standby Validators.

__Two-layer design__
The *Æ*sir protocol consists of two distinct layers. One allows for delegators to vote on proposals (or submit a proposal) inside of a Staking Pool. The other layer lets Validators ""signal"" the voting results from each Staking Pool to see if a network-wide change has either passed or failed.

The validator for each Staking Pool can vote on behalf of every active delegator should they choose not to participate. [This mechanism](https://medium.com/thorchain/governing-thorchain-b04f1f0f656f) ""serves as a hybrid between direct and representative democracy."" But the goal is to achieve 100% voter turnout within each pool. THORChain also plans to implement [Quadratic Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting) within Staking Pools to inhibit plutocracies. As part of the network's consensus mechanism, delegators can re-delegate at any time. Staking Pool votes must achieve a simple majority (51% threshold) to pass and move on to the Validator signaling stage.

As for the signaling layer, Validators will be able to read all current proposals as well as nominate their own changes each block. Unlike the Staking Pools, proposals at the Validator level must receive a supermajority (two-thirds or 67%) for the change to take effect. Validators that don't participate in the signaling period will get part of their stake slashed and redistributed to other Validators.

Validators can also implement a grace period prior to voting, depending on the severity of the proposed amendment. Similar to Tezos, THORChain validators can opt to run ""sweeping architectural changes"" on the project's testnet before implementing them to the mainnet.",,,

The level of voting or computational power is proportional to the number of tokens held or staked.

Unlike Ethereum or Bitcoin, EOS token transfers do not require a fee, as users do not need to entice miners to include their transaction(s) in the next block. EOS block producers earn new tokens only through the creation of new blocks. But transactions are not entirely free because users and developers still need to acquire network resources in proportion to their intended on-chain activity levels.

The network resources required to submit transactions and run dApps include:
CPU: the processing power it takes to operate a dApp and read data from a storage device (measured in microseconds)
NET: network bandwidth or the average rate of data transfer through the communication protocol (measured in bytes)
RAM: data storage

The network's current inflation rate is 1%, split between the Block Producers (BPs) and Standby Producers, who received 0.25% and 0.75% of the annual inflation rate respectively. While BPs must share a smaller piece of the total reward pool, there are only 21 BPs; thus, they receive more daily EOS rewards on average than their counterparts. Standby Producers represent potential block producers ranked outside of the top 21 that have enough voting support from token holders to receive a minimum daily reward of 100 EOS.

Historic supply and inflation changes
At launch, the inflation rate for EOS was 5%, but this metric was somewhat misleading as the network routed 4% of newly minted tokens into the eosio.saving account. The supply directed to this account was illiquid and only accessible by way of a successful vote among the network's 21 block producers (BPs). The rest of the outstanding inflation went to BPs and Standby Producers per the same percentage breakdown described above.

BPs can also vote on decreasing or increasing the inflation rate. Therefore, these network representatives can impact the future supply of EOS by altering the block reward or changing the contents of the eosio.saving account, an act that has happened twice since inception.

On May 8, 2019, BPs opted to burn all of the tokens collected in the eosio.saving account up until that point, which amounted to 34 million EOS. The inflation rate remained intact, however, so that account continued to accrue 80% of the newly issued (but still illiquid) EOS supply.

In Feb. 2020, fifteen of the twenty-one BPs voted again to burn the over 34 million EOS tokens (worth almost $140 million at the time) held in the eosio.saving account. This vote also reduced the inflation rate of the network from 5% to its current rate of 1%. This inflation reduction only eliminated the 80% of block rewards previously dedicated to the eosio.saving account, effectively eliminating the role of that account on the network. Since the contents of the eosio.saving account were already illiquid, the vote's impact on the circulating supply and real inflation rate was minimal.

Block.one vesting schedule
Block.one allocated itself 100 million EOS tokens at launch to fund future ecosystem development. These tokens will unlock linearly every second over a period of ten years starting from the network's Genesis Block on Jun. 6, 2018. In May 2019, Block.one claimed a vested batch of 9.8 million EOS and used 3.3 million of these tokens (worth ~$25 million at the time) to purchase network RAM. The firm now only holds the current and future rights to 96.7 million EOS tokens.

Impact of the eosio.ramfee account
Until May 1, 2019, and the launch of Resource Exchange (REX) on EOS Mainnet, the fees collected from RAM trading (0.5% of the value of each trade) were sent and stored on the eosio.ramfee account.  From May 1, 2019, the fees are now directly transferred from the eosio.ramfee to the REX, but the funds (approximately 2M EOS) that were located in the eosio.ramfee account before the upgrade will not be allocated to the REX and remain illiquid. 

Blacklisted accounts
EOSIO also has a feature that allows Block Producers to blacklist accounts. All the Block Producers need to blacklist an account in order for the blacklist to happen. Those blacklisted accounts' supply is considered illiquid since it is no longer transferable.  ",Inflationary,Fixed Inflation rate,False,,"EOS's <a href=""https://messari.io/article/delegated-proof-of-stake"">delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)</a> is based on 21 Block Producers (BPs) voted on by token holders, where votes are weighted by the number of tokens held and holders can opt to delegate their votes to another holder on their behalf. Anyone can participate in the block production so long as they can receive enough votes, and the vote is ongoing so at any time BP's can be replaced by another entity voters believe will act in their best interests.

Blocks are produced every 0.5 seconds and one BP produces a block at any given time. Once 15 BP’s sign a block, it is deemed irreversible. Under normal conditions, DPoS does not experience <a href=""https://messari.io/article/fork"">forks</a> because rather than competing, BPs cooperate to produce blocks. In the event of a fork, consensus will automatically switch to the longest chain because the rate at which blocks are added to a fork is directly correlated to the percentage of BP’s that share the same consensus.

The decision-making process for EOS' on-chain governance is well-defined; however, governance debates, which can influence on-chain decisions, still occur off-chain. The strict on-chain rules often increase the activity of off-chain politics, as various stakeholders engage in community discussions surrounding any new proposals or ongoing voting sessions.",Delegated On-Chain Vote,"EOS features on-chain governance that processes voting through its delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) system. Similar to how EOS stakeholders vote on block producers, this model allows token holders to vote on protocol decisions that are automatically implemented or rejected depending on the final vote tally. Votes are weighted by the number of tokens held, and holders can opt to delegate their votes to another holder on their behalf. Protocol decisions can consist of changes to the system parameters, updates to the User Agreement, or alterations on the inflation rate, among others.

__EOS Constitution replaced for the new User Agreement__
Block.one initially instituted a [Constitution](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/5068823fbc8a8f7d29733309c0496438c339f7dc/constitution.md) (now outdated) for the protocol, which consisted of various articles defining how users, developers, and validators should act on-chain. It served [as the](https://multicoin.capital/2018/04/24/eos-analysis-and-valuation/) ""terms of service agreement in the software that bound stakeholders together through a set of bylaws."" While well-intentioned, the Constitutional ran into some early roadblocks. Dan Larimer even proposed a new version that looked to remove the Arbitration Forum/establishment of the block producers as the jury and implement a supermajority vote required to freeze any account or contract, among other clarifications.

Despite Larimer's contribution, the community opted to develop its own solution, resulting in an open-source governance framework dubbed the EOS User Agreement. BPs [approved](https://steemit.com/eos/@lukestokes/the-eos-user-agreement-is-live) the User Agreement by a majority vote (15/21), and the agreement officially replaced the old Constitution in April 2019.

Both staking and governance are limited currently, but will be integrated as per the roadmap. $AXS serves secondarily as legal tender in the Axie marketplace, where in-game NFTs may be purchased. Finally, $AXS acts as work token in that it is spent, along with $SLP (discussed below) in order to breed new Axies. Breeding fees are currently 4 $AXS and are directed to the treasury.

$AXS is an ERC-20 token, meaning that users with Ethereum wallets can freely buy and sell it. It can be acquired or sold on a variety of marketplaces, including Binance and Uniswap. 

Axie Infinity actually uses a dual-token structure. Smooth Love Potion ($SLP) is the other in-game fungible ERC-20 token. SLP is burned to enable Axies to breed and create new Axies.

It has both standardized tokens on multiple blockchains and native tokens on its mainnet. FTM, or Fantom token, is the native currency for the project, used as both a means of exchange and unit of account in payments. This is most significant in the context of block rewards issued to validators and delegators to compensate their network participation. Fantom has expanded significantly into DeFi though, with several new use cases now evident for FTM in a currency sense.

On Fantom's mainnet (i.e., Opera), FTM tokens are used to pay transaction and smart contract execution fees. They also may be used to secure the network through Opera's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, and to vote on-chain in Fantom's governance matters. This PoS mechanism of Opera sits atop the underlying asynchronous byzantine-fault tolerant (aBFT) system known as Lachesis (detailed further in the ""Technology"" section) derived from a directed acyclic graph (DAG) architecture. Network validators must stake FTM to run a node, at least 500,000 FTM, and thereafter will collect a proportional share of staking rewards. Users that don't run a node can delegate their tokens to an existing validator to earn a portion of staking rewards and network fees. Voting power is proportional to the amount a validator has staked plus any delegations received.

The recommended wallet software for storing, staking, and participating in governance of Fantom is fWallet, with instructions for setup here. Users of FTM standardized tokens (e.g., ERC-20) may use their existing favorite wallet or select from many including industry-stalwart MetaMask (as described here). Those who stake their tokens (either flexible or fixed-term) will earn FTM rewards for staking their holdings, which in turn aids in securing the Fantom Network. The yield for those staking, generated by way of inflationary emissions from pre-mined reserves, varies subject to lock-up term. Staking may be done either directly or by delegation. Of note, tokens staked with a validator have a seven day unbonding period.","Crowdsale, Private Sale","Prior to mainnet launch, the entirety of Fantom's token supply has been mined. Of these, approximately fourty percent were sold to private investors in three rounds; a smaller one-and-a-half percent allocation was made available for public investors in Fantom's crowdsale. Founders, the project team, and advisors collectively represent approximately twenty percent of the token supply. The remainder thus is split between the smaller strategic reserve and the pre-mined rewards reserve, which begin distribution on mainnet launch (December 2019), and are set to be depleted in the second quarter of 2022.

The token sales rounds are referred to herein as the Seed Round, Private Sale I, Private Sale II, and the Public Sale. The tokens sold to private investors were subject to vesting requirements which have largely since been fulfilled, and are reflected in the supply curve herein. For the first three rounds, access was restricted to select participants who met the regulatory definition of ""accredited investors"" according to United States and international dictums.","[{'title': 'Seed Sale', 'start_date': '2018-02-01T11:00:00Z', 'type': 'SAFT', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2018-02-10T11:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 100000000, 'asset_collected': 'USD', 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.016, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 1600000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Private Sale I', 'start_date': '2018-03-31T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'SAFT', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2018-05-08T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 805021058, 'asset_collected': 'USD', 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.031, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 24800000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Private Sale II', 'start_date': '2018-05-15T10:00:00Z', 'type': 'SAFT', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2018-06-08T10:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 370844672, 'asset_collected': 'USD', 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.035, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 12900000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Public Sale', 'start_date': '2018-06-15T10:00:00Z', 'type': 'ICO', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2018-06-16T10:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 50000000, 'asset_collected': 'ETH', 'price_per_token_in_asset': 8.634e-05, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.04, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 4317, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 2648762.44, 'is_kyc_required': True, 'restricted_jurisdictions': ['Zimbabwe', 'Yemen', 'Vanuatu', 'United States', 'Ukraine', 'Tunisia', 'Syrian Arab Republic', 'Sudan', 'Sri Lanka', 'Somalia', 'Russian Federation', 'Myanmar', 'Libyan Arab Jamahiriya', 'Lebanon', ""Korea, Democratic People'S Republic of"", 'Korea, Republic of', 'Japan', 'Iraq', 'Iran, Islamic Republic Of', 'Guinea-Bissau', 'Ethiopia', 'Eritrea', 'Congo, The Democratic Republic of the', 'China', 'Central African Republic', 'Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'Australia', 'Afghanistan']}]",[],[],,"[{'category': 'Founders & Team', 'amount_in_percentage': 7.49}, {'category': 'Advisors & Contributors', 'amount_in_percentage': 12}, {'category': 'Private Investors', 'amount_in_percentage': 40.18}, {'category': 'Public Investors', 'amount_in_percentage': 1.57}, {'category': 'Treasury and Reward Reserves', 'amount_in_percentage': 38.76}]",3175000000.0,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': 41.76, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': 25.49, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': 32.75}",2018-06-15T00:00:00Z,2019-12-27T05:00:00Z,"Overview

Fantom's outstanding supply is fixed. The liquid supply increase displayed on the curve is the consequence of the vesting schedules detailed in the Launch section as well as the distribution of premined staking rewards. Those rewards are set to be distributed continuously to validators and delegators. These expected distributions are forecast to end in 2024 once the allocated source is depleted, given the project's fixed supply not allowing for further minting of FTM.

Inflation and Token Rewards

Network participants who own the FTM token are incentivized to stake their holdings, either directly as a validator or by way of delegation to one. Staking helps to protect the network, and earns an annual return of up to fourteen percent at present. The yield for staking is variable. FTM has inflationary emissions occuring at a generally decreasing rate, designed to decrease with the proliferation of Fantom network to more users. This rate varies, currently ranging from four to fourteen percent, depending on whether participants ""lock up"" their FTM or not (from fourteen days to one year); longer terms generate higher yields.

Supply Reductions

Generally not applicable. However, in limited circumstances tokens may be burnt. Besides one-time events, this would occur in instances of an on-chain governance motion being created.

Slashing may occur for various transactions deemed harmful to the network.","Inflationary, Fixed Supply","Premined Rewards, Dynamic Emission",True,3175000000.0,"Fantom operates a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model called Lachesis that allows for asynchronous confirmation of transactions. This means transactions are confirmed as soon as they enter the network without needing to wait for previous transactions to be confirmed. Users are able to complete their transactions with near-instantaneous finality as Fantom allows for the use of multiple distributed ledgers with the consensus at its core. Each decentralized ledger has the ability to communicate with each other to send transaction data as necessary. As a proof-of-stake system, both stakers and delegators can earn rewards for each epoch. To become a validator, a user needs to stake FTM to operate and receive transaction fee rewards. Delegators support validator nodes and also receive awards but pay a fifteen fee to the validator. Similar to other PoS systems, malicious stakers will see their tokens slashed.

In addition to a five-hundred thousand FTM minimum staked balance, validators will require hardware and technical expertise (i.e., DevOps and systems administration). The hardware requirement is derived from Amazon Web Services' m5.xlarge standard, thus requiring four high-performance CPU cores, 16GB memory, four terabytes of disk space and a 10Gbps network connection.","Proof-Of-Stake, DAG",Lachesis,1.0,,,,False,,"Anyone can offer their services to help develop Fantom Network and the surrounding ecosystem.

The contract supports multi-delegations between voters, meaning voters can delegate their vote to another user. Each proposal can diverge into multiple options and votes can be held for each option. No limit to proposals are in place; any user can submit any proposal they deem relevant [here](https://vote.fantom.network). Fantom uses a proposal template for users to fill out. Proposals must also be submitted with specific parameters, including address of a voter in the delegation or a self-address if the submitter is an individual, proposal ID, and an array of vote choices. Proposals can be created at any time. They can also be canceled if a vote has not taken place. Each action requires a fee, which gets burnt during the operation. Voters select a single option from the listed choices during the voting for the proposal. If voter turnout is below a minimum value, the proposal gets rejected.

How to Earn Helium Tokens
There are five ways Hotspots earn tokens:
Network Data Transfer: Hotspots transfer data packets from devices using the network and are rewarded proportionally for their overall share of data transferred. 
Proof-of-Coverage: Hotspots validate their peer's wireless coverage
Witnesses: Hotspots monitor and report Proof-of-Coverage
Consensus Group: Hotspots validate transactions and publish new blocks. The likelihood of participating in this consensus process is based on a reputation score that changes based on Proof-of-Coverage participation
Challenges: Hotspots are chosen to encrypt messages over the Internet to a target group of Hotspots. These challenges are used by Proof-of-Coverage to validate wireless coverage. ",Fair Launch with Built-in Treasury,"There is no premine of the Helium token. Once the mainnet went live, all Hotspots on the network began receiving Helium Tokens based on their participation in things like Proof of Coverage and being part of consensus groups.

Additionally, the protocol has a built-in ""founders' reward."" This reward is equal to 10% of the total (21m) tokens outstanding and are distributed via miner block rewards over the first four years after launch.

5.72% to Founders, Employees, Advisers
1.65% to Electronic Coin Company Equity Investors
1.44% to Zcash Foundation
1.19% to Electronic Coin Company Strategic Reserve

The allocation between the Founders, Employees, & Advisers and the Strategic Reserve will fluctuate over time as new employees are added and their tokens vest. These were the initial distribution intentions, but they are likely to mix between these two buckets.

Zcash also featured a slow start at the launch of the network: for the first 20,000 blocks, the number of ZEC mined per block grew linearly from 0 toward 12.5. Thus the 20,000th block was the first block with a 12.5 ZEC block reward.

Mining
Miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks using a Equihash algorithm. In this process, miners compete to generate a <a href=""https://messari.io/blog/hash-function"">hash</a> less than the target number set by Zcashs <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level"">difficulty adjustment algorithm</a>. The target difficulty level is adjusted every block.

Zcash originally implemented the Equihash algorithm for its memory intensive properties, which made it more resistant to <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics"">ASICs</a>; however, over time Zcash's ASIC resistant properties have eroded with Equihash-capable ASICs having been developed. Furthermore, in order to smooth individual miner revenue as mining has become more competitive, mining is now done in pools where participants contribute <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/hash-power"">hash power</a> to the pool and receive a proportional share of the profits if the pool finds a valid block.",Proof-of-Work,Nakamoto Consensus,75.0,3.125,Equihash,2020-11-18T00:00:00Z,False,,"Zcash is an open source community; historically most protocol development is largely handled by The Electric Coin Company. The Electric Coin Company maintains “zcashd,” the only production-ready node implementation. Protocol development is governed by the Zcash Improvement Proposal process (ZIP) whereby anyone in the open source Zcash community can submit draft ZIPs. After discussion by the Zcash community, the ZIP editors, features are selected for the upcoming network upgrade. Daira Hopwood, Principal Engineer of the Electric Coin Company and George Tankersley, Director of Engineering of the Zcash Foundation, accept or reject the ZIPs. Decisions from the ZIP process are written into the Zcash specification, as well as the software that runs the network. Finally, protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus.

The Electric Coin Company and the Zcash Foundation are the two organizations who receive an allocation of the founder’s reward every block until the 850,000th block is mined at which point they will have cumulatively received 10% of the 21 million ZEC that will ever be mined. The Electric Coin Company is a for-profit organization that launched and supports the Zcash protocol. The Zcash foundation is a 501(c)3 public charity, dedicated to building internet payment and privacy infrastructure for the public good. Moving forward the Zcash foundation plans further decentralize the Zcash project through promoting competing node implementations, increasing community involvement, and ultimately reducing the influence of both itself and the Electric Coin Company on the Zcash protocol. Meaningful steps to this end include the Electric Coin Company donating the Zcash trademark to Zcash Foundation and the Development Fund discussion that is currently underway and will go into effect in October 2020",,,False,,

The Flow blockchain will have an initial bootstrapping phase to create the initial circulating supply for the network through staking rewards paid to anyone willing to lock their FLOW token and participate in the network. During the bootstrapping phase, at least 20M FLOW tokens will be distributed, representing approximately 1.6% monetary inflation. Staking rewards begin accruing after November 2, 2020 and are paid out every epoch (approximately weekly).

Long Term
New issuance on Flow is used for staking rewards in cases when transaction fees are not sufficient to compensate delegators and validator node operators. On or before December 15, 2020, the total new issuance rate across the network is capped at 5% per year. This cap will go down to 3% after June 1, 2022. New issuance “tops up” the transaction fees to a minimum guaranteed income for node operators. If fees cover the income guarantees, new issuance goes to 0. Therefore, as the Flow blockchain gains adoption and fees increase, the issuance should eventually remain at zero while fees make up a majority of network rewards.”

Note: There is an additional 250 million FLOW tokens, half of which will be held in the foundation reserve for staking and delegation only while the other half is intended as collateral subsidies to secondary protocols. As a result of the intended lockup, these tokens are not reflected in the circulating supply.

Indexers earn query fees and indexer rewards for their services.

Curators are subgraph developers, data consumers or community members who signal to Indexers which APIs should be indexed by The Graph Network. Curators deposit GRT into a bonding curve to signal on a specific subgraph and earn a portion of query fees for the subgraphs they signal on; incentivizing the highest quality data sources. Curators will curate on subgraphs and deposit GRT via the Graph Explorer dApp. Because this occurs on a bonding curve, that means that earlier signals gain greater share of the query fees on that subgraph for a given amount of GRT deposited. 

Delegators are individuals who would like to contribute to securing the network but do not want to run a Graph Node themselves. Delegators contribute by delegating GRT to existing Indexers and they earn a portion of query fees and indexing rewards in return. Delegators select Indexers based on their performance on measures like query fee rates, past slashing and uptime as well as delegator parameters like the cut of fees and rewards from the Indexer. Delegators will delegate and undelegate GRT on Indexers via the Graph Explorer dApp.

Consumers are the end-users of The Graph that query subgraphs and pay query fees to the Indexers, Curators and Delegators. Consumers are likely to be developers or projects themselves that cover query fees for their applications as they would AWS or cloud service costs. However, some applications will pass on query fees to users or bundle the cost in product fees. Consumers will pay for query fees via “gateways” or wallets that will be built on top of open source contracts in The Graph Network.

Indexers that stake GRT operate in a query marketplace where they earn query fees for indexing services and serving queries to subgraphs - like serving Uniswap trade data on Uniswap.info. The price of these queries will be set by Indexers and vary based on cost to index the subgraph, the demand for queries, the amount of curation signal and the market rate for blockchain queries. Since Consumers (ie. applications) are paying for queries, the aggregate cost is expected to be much lower than the costs of running a server and database.

A Gateway can be used to allow consumers to connect to the network and to facilitate payments. The team behind The Graph will initially run a set of gateways that allows applications to cover the query costs on behalf of their users. These gateways facilitate connecting to The Graph Network. Anyone will be able to run their own gateways as well. Gateways handle state channel logistics for query fees, and route to Indexers as a function of price, performance and security that is predetermined by the application paying for those queries.

In addition to query fees, Indexers and Delegators will earn indexing rewards in the form of GRT that is new token issuance distributed proportional to Curator signal and allocated stake. Indexing rewards will start at 3% annually. Future GRT monetary policy will be set by an independent technical governance which will be established as after network launch.

The Graph Network will have epochs which are measured in blocks and are used for the Indexing Rewards calculations.

In addition to query fees and indexing rewards, there is a Rebate Pool that rewards all network participants based on their contributions to The Graph Network. The rebate pool is designed to encourage Indexers to allocate stake in rough proportion to the amount of query fees they earn for the network.

GRT that is staked in the protocol is subject to a thawing period and can be slashed if Indexers are malicious and serve incorrect data to applications or if they index incorrectly. Curators and Delegators cannot be slashed for bad behavior, yet there is a withdrawal tax on Curators and Delegators to disincentivize poor decision making that could harm the integrity of the network. Curators also earn fewer query fees if they choose to curate on a low-quality subgraph, since there will be fewer queries to process or fewer indexers to process those queries.

These submissions undergo a community debate, and once a consensus has emerged, the Waves project team can merge the approved changes to the Waves Node GitHub repository. Protocol changes do not activate once merged, however, as at least 80% of network miners must first accept the changes and download the new code to initiate the update. Once the miners vote in favor of an update, the new network functions become available to all network users and developers.

Huobi offers discounts on trading and margin fees based on how many HT were held over the prior 30 days. Additional fee discounts are given to Professional users, defined as holding more than $5,000 HT and 1,000 BTC equivalent value in 30-day trading volume. For those holding more than 100,000 HT, an additional 35% is deducted from the fee rate.

Huobi Prime tickets
Huobi Prime is the company’s IEO platform than enables direct token offerings. They were designed to allow retail investors to invest in primary sales while limiting the purchase of tokens to an equivalent of $1,000 for early investors. Once the token sale is completed, they will be immediately tradeable against HT on the exchange. Huobi Prime listings occur in three rounds with larger discounts typically given in the earlier rounds. Participation typically requires a minimum average monthly HT and the trading quota is based on a tiered system of HT holdings. Once ticket sales are complete, the HT received are subsequently burnt.

FastTrack voting
Every month, five projects are announced and then voted on by the community for listing on Huobi’s exchange. The project with the highest number of votes will be listed, while the others go towards the next week’s voting. Users that voted for the winning project are eligible to purchase tokens at a discounted value. All profits from FastTrack are used to repurchase HT that is subsequently burned.",Airdrop,"Huobi launched its token by distributing 60% of the tokens to users who purchased pre-paid services on the platform.

Miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks using a <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/sha-256"">SHA-256</a> algorithm. In this process, miners compete to generate a <a href=""https://messari.io/blog/hash-function"">hash</a> less than the target number set by Bitcoin SV's <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level"">difficulty adjustment algorithm</a>. Notably, the target difficulty level is adjusted every block as opposed to Bitcoin's every 2016 blocks.

Although open to anyone with a CPU, Bitcoin SV mining is now dominated by <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics"">ASICs</a> usually situated in enterprise scale data centers. Furthermore in order to smooth individual miner revenue as mining has become more competitive, mining is now done in pools where participants contribute <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/hash-power"">hash power</a> to the pool and receive a proportional share of the profits if the pool finds a valid block.

For a node to issue a valid transaction, the node must solve a cryptographic puzzle similar to those in the Bitcoin blockchain to two previous transactions. This is achieved by finding a nonce such that the hash of that nonce concatenated with some data from the approved transaction has a particular form. It is assumed that nodes individually check to see if any transactions are conflicting. There are no rewards for validating transactions or incentives for running full nodes.

As transactions receive additional approvals, they are accepted by the system with a higher level of confidence.As transactions gain additional approvals they gain weight, which is proportional to the amount of work that the issuing node invested into it. Transactions accumulate additional weight with each transaction that directly or indirectly refers to it. 

The time is takes for transactions to get approved is inversely proportional to the amount transactions being issued on the network. Once transactions are approved their weight will grow at the rate of the incoming flow of transactions.

Originally IOTA used its own hash function for PoW and key generation called Curl; however, it has since changed to Troika after security vulnerabilities were found in Curl.

The Coordinator
Although not mentioned in the whitepaper, the IOTA network currently relies on a coordinator node that provides trusted milestone transactions, and snapshots which are used to reduce the size of the network. The coordinator node is a special node that is operated by the IOTA foundation designed to protect the IOTA network from attacks while it grows. 

The coordinator node issues milestones every minute, which reference valid transactions. Milestones are special transactions published by the Coordinator that keep the Tangle from branching out too widely, which could result in bifurcations of the ledger. It effectively pulls branches back to the main tangle, resolving potential double spends in the process. Transactions on IOTA are only treated as confirmed if they are referenced by a milestone. All nodes running the IOTA software treat all transactions referenced by the coordinated as valid.",DAG,Tangle,,,Troika,,False,,"The IOTA Foundation is primarily responsible for funding and leading development of IOTA.

The MKR token is used for governance of the platform allowing holders to vote on various parameters such as the stability fee, debt ceiling, types of collateral to be used, Dai Savings Rate and more. MKR is also used to purchase excess Dai from collateral auctions and stability fee payments in the Surplus Auction. Once the auction is ended the protocol automatically burns the MKR leading to a decreasing supply. However, if there is a shortfall of Dai resulting from loans becoming undercollateralized, a Debt Auction will occur to raise more Dai by printing MKR, thereby increasing the supply.

Anyone is free to submit a proposal which then goes through a Governance Poll to establish rough community consensus. Polls can be proactive to account for one-off or intermittent issues that need to be addressed for future issues, or they can be reactive to respond to a present state change. Once there is general agreement, the issue is put up for an Executive Vote where MKR holders vote to enact the change.

Examples of changes that can be made include:
New collateral types with their own unique risk parameters such as Collateralization Ratio and debt ceiling
Selection of oracle feeds to input the market price of various collateral assets
Modifications to the Stability Fee or Dai Savings Rate
Allocations of funds from the Maker Buffer which include the totally system’s revenues from Liquidation and Stability Fees
Triggering Emergency Shutdown

Emergency Shutdown
A critical component of Maker governance is the Emergency Shutdown capability. It serves two functions: to shutdown the old system in the event of a major upgrade as we will see with single collateral Dai, or as a last resort mechanism in the event of any malicious governance activity, attack or security breach. Once 50,000 MKR are placed in the Emergency Shutdown Module, it is enacted immediately to shut down the system and return collateral to Dai holders and Vault owners. Vault owners can withdraw their collateral minus the Dai debt owed which is then available for Dai holders through the main collateral claim process. This is a manual process where Dai holders use Dai to claim collateral at a fixed rate corresponding to the calculated value based on the Dai Target Price. In receiving their proportional claim of the collateral portfolio they could be at risk of a haircut due to the risk in decline of collateral value.

Governance Security Module (GSM)
After an Executive Vote gets passed, there is a 24-hour delay period before the change gets deployed to give stakeholders time to review the code and maintain the integrity of the system. If they believe the change is detrimental to the system, MKR holders can opt for an Emergency Shutdown so that all stakeholders receive their fair value currently locked in the system.

MakerDAO hosts weekly governance calls on Thursdays 4pm UTC",Direct On-Chain Vote,"While Governance Polls are conducted over discrete time periods to gauge community consensus, Executive Votes are continuous and represent the state of the system at all times. At any point in time, a proposal can be introduced that represents a new state of the protocol, which means MKR holders must continuously monitor for these changes and vote accordingly. In order to vote, MKR holders need to keep their tokens in a voting construct where they are then free to shift to competing proposals. Therefore the expectation is that MKR holders will play an active role in governance, deciding how the system evolves over time.",False,,

Governance with time-weighted voting
Value capture mechanism to promote certain pools
Locking mechanism to accrue rewards for long term liquidity providers
Fee burn (once enabled by governance further down the road)

$CRV, an ERC-20 standard token, is Curve Finance's native coin for governance. The $CRV token controls the protocol and gives holders the ability to submit proposals and potential changes to the allocations of pools. Voters can examine each pool and decide on different allocations that may generate higher or more secure returns (APY). The amount of voting power a user has is determined by both the amount of $CRV tokens they stake and the amount of time they stake it. Users who have staked more tokens or for a longer period of time will possess greater voting rights. 

Users are incentivized to lock their $CRV tokens within the protocol in return for $veCRV tokens (vote locking address). Once these funds are locked for over a week, veCRV tokens will be available to vote for gauge weights. Also, those who lock $CRV are entitled to fees generated by the protocol’s liquidity pools. Currently, one needs 2500 $veCRV (the equivalent of 10000 $CRV locked for a year) to be able to create a new vote. This voting boost for users who lock their tokens serves as an incentive for users to truly invest themselves in the future of the Curve DAO. Vote locking also increases ones' CRV liquidity providing rewards.",,"Curve Finance launched their $CRV token on August 14th, 2020. The total supply of $CRV tokens to be issued is 3.03 billion with an initial supply of around 1.3 billion tokens. 

The initial supply of 1.3 billion is distributed as follows: 5% to pre-CRV liquidity providers (with 1 year vesting, where 1/365 of rewards unlock every 24 hours), 30% to the Curve team and investors, 3% to employees (with 2 year vesting), and 5% to the community reserve.The fully diluted 3.03 billion in supply will be distributed as follows: 62% goes to liquidity providers, 30% to team and investors (with 2-4 year vesting), 3% to employees (with 2 year vesting) and 5% to the community reserve. 

This distribution schedule meant for the first year about 2 million new CRV tokens (~0.067% of the supply) where distributed each day. After the initial 1.3 billion is distributed, the remaining supply will be issued at a decreasing weight of 2.25 per year; this means the supply will not be fully diluted until around the year 2320.

The stated goal of the Curve token distribution is to slowly shift voting power from the Curve team and investors to the liquidity providers.",[],,[],,[],1300000000.0,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': 30, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': None, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': None}",2020-08-13T00:00:00Z,,,Inflationary,Decreasing Inflation rate,True,3303030299.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Stacks network operates on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and leverages its Proof-of-Work (<a href=""https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work"">PoW</a>) security model. The Hiro PBC team selected this approach because bootstrapping a PoW network is difficult and time-consuming, and it would compete directly with Bitcoin to win mining resources. Instead of mimicking Bitcoin's success outright, Blockstack miners participate in a Proof-of-Transfer consensus model, where miners relinquish their BTC as the economic cost for their participation (akin to electricity and equipment costs in traditional mining). 

In the event of a fork (if two different miners propose valid blocks simultaneously), Stacks clients will need to eventually select the longest fork as the valid chain. This design is similar in nature to Bitcoin, where the fork with the most accumulated ""work"" is considered the correct chain.

Leader selection
The likelihood of winning the right to mine the next block (and earn the block reward and any accompanying transaction fees) increases with the amount of Bitcoin a miner burns compared to other participants. On a more granular level, Stacks determines the next block via a verifiable random function (VRF). VRFs to ensure the miner selection process remains random and impractical to game.",Other,Proof-of-Transfer,,,,,,,"At the moment, Hiro PBC (formerly Blockstack PBC) develops and releases new network software.

Each of Celo's first two private asset sales had vesting schedules attached to the purchaser agreements. The CELO sold in 2018 will vest linearly every month for two years starting from mainnet launch. As for the second sale in 2019, purchasers received the option to pay $1.00 per token with a one-year lockup or $0.75 per token, which would add three-years to the base on-year lockup. The discount also included the option for purchasers to forgo the return of reserve funds in the event the mainnet release did not occur.

The project's most recent auction did not have any known restrictions on CELO once the governance system unlocks asset transfers; therefore, we assume all assets are liquid once token transitions are live. The cLabs team, founder, advisor, and contributor CELO allocations will vest over a five-year timeframe.

Ongoing Treasury sales
The Sales category in the supply curve accounts for all pre-launch sales and ongoing treasury sales from the Celo Foundation. The Foundation will periodically sell portions of its CELO treasury to fund operations and grant programs (Celo Foundation Treasury Policy). These sales will ideally occur at fixed intervals with an approximate target of 3% (but no more than 5%) of the rolling previous seven-day average trading volume of CELO. The Foundation doesn't anticipate any repurchase of CELO on the open market.

cUSD reserve
Up to120 million CELO will be dedicated to the programmatic reserve that helps maintain the 1:1 peg of Celo Dollar to the US Dollar. This model assumes the reserve will receive half (60 million CELO) of this allocation in the first year. The exact schedule and amounts released will depend upon demand for cUSD (expansions) as well as changes in the prices of reserve assets over time. Also, the reserve will hold 50% of its capital in non-CELO assets. If demand does not increase, the remaining reserve CELO allocation will not be liquid.

Epoch rewards
The network will also feature an ongoing issuance in the form of epoch rewards (batch of block rewards). Epoch rewards will distribute the remaining 400 million CELO of the one billion max supply. At the end of each epoch, 75% (300 million total) of newly issued assets will go to network validators, while the Community Fund (24.5%) and a carbon offsetting fund (0.5%) receive smaller portions. All of these distribution models or how these CELO get spent is subject to on-chain governance and sufficient stability protocol reserves.

As for Celo's inflation rate, the proposed target curve (subject to change) of epoch rewards declines linearly over 15 years to 50% of the total 400 million CELO dedicated to ongoing issuance. After this first 15 years, the inflation rate decays exponentially with a half life of h=ln(2)×15=10.3h. This model does not incorporate changes to the rewards multiplier, which is a governable adjustment factor that can account for underspending or overspending.",Inflationary,Decreasing Inflation rate,True,1000000000.0,"Proof of Stake consensus
Celo uses a Proof of Stake consensus algorithm. In comparison to Proof of Work systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, it aims to limit negative environmental impact and computational effort required by validators to reach consensus, which could translate to faster transaction speeds.

The protocol also offers incentives for running full nodes to service the light clients that run on each mobile device. In Celo, users can still earn inflation rewards in exchange for providing compute resources without having to stake funds.

Hardware requirements for a Celo Validator
The recommended Celo Validator setup involves continually running three instances:
1 Validator node: should be deployed to single-tenant hardware in a secure, high availability data center
1 Validator Proxy node: can be a VM or container in a multi-tenant environment (e.g. a public cloud), but requires high availability
1 Attestation node: can be a VM or container in a multi-tenant environment (e.g. a public cloud), and has moderate availability requirements

Celo is a Proof of Stake network, which has different hardware requirements than a Proof of Work network. PoS consensus is less CPU intensive but is more sensitive to network connectivity and latency. Below is a list of standard requirements for running Validator and Proxy nodes on the Celo Network: Memory:
8 GB RAM
CPU: Quad core 3GHz (64-bit)
Disk: 256 GB of SSD storage, plus a secondary HDD desirable

Celo uses a formal on-chain governance mechanism to manage and upgrade the protocol such as for upgrading smart contracts, adding new stable currencies, or modifying the reserve target asset allocation. All changes must be agreed upon by CELO holders. A quorum threshold model is used to determine the number of votes needed for a proposal to pass.

Changes are managed via the Celo Governance smart contract. This contract acts as an ""owner"" for making modifications to other protocol smart contracts. Such smart contracts are termed governable. The Governance contract will at first be owned by a multi-signature wallet. In the future, when the community's experience of DAOs (Distributed Autonomous Organizations) has evolved and when the platform has proven to be stable and secure, it will be owned by CELO holders effectively acting as a DAO.

The change procedure happens in the following phases:
1. Proposal
2. Approval
3. Referendum
4. Execution  

__Hotfix proposal__
The cadence and transparency of the standard on-chain governance protocol make it poorly suited for proposals that patch issues that may compromise the security of the network, especially when the patch would reveal an exploitable bug in one of the core contracts. Instead, these sorts of changes are better suited for the more responsive, and less transparent, hotfix protocol.

Anyone can make a proposal in the hotfix protocol by submitting the hash of their proposal to the Governance smart contract. If that hash is approved by the approver and a quorum of validators, the proposer can execute the contents of that proposal immediately.

Note that this means the validators may not always know the contents of the proposal that they are voting on. Revealing the contents of the proposal to all validators may compromise the integrity of the hotfix protocol, as only one validator would need to be malicious in order to exploit the vulnerability or share it publicly. Instead, to convince the validators that the hash represents a proposal that should be executed via the hotfix protocol, the proposer should consider contacting reputable, third party, security firms to publicly vouch for the contents of the proposal.

The sale had a hard cap of $22.0 million at a price of 116,060 ZIL per ETH. Initially, the project planned to raise up to $20.0 million but adjusted the cap due to the rise in ETH prices.

Only members of the community Slack or Telegram channels before Nov. 29, 2017, were eligible to participate in the sale. Each community member was capped at a total of 2.5 – 5.0 ETH during the sale. Early supporters that provided funding or other support to the project were eligible for an extra 10 – 15% “bonus” allocation on top of the tokens they received through the sale.

A total of 21.00 billion ZIL were created, and allocated as follows:
30% was distributed through the public sale.
10% was allocated to Anquan Capital
12% was allocated to Zilliqa Research
5.0% was allocated to the Founding Team
3.0% was allocated to various supporting agencies including Bitcoin Suisse
40%  was reserved for future mining rewards, which will be distributed over a ten year period.

Tokens allocated to Anquan Capital, Zilliqa Research, the founding team, and supporting agencies, excluding Bitcoin Suisse, are subject to a vesting plan which releases new tokens quarterly over a three year period. Of the funds raised in the token sale, $17.6 million will go to research, development, and operations. Anquan Capital was allocated $3.3 million of the proceeds, and the remaining $1.1 million was rewarded to the founding team.","[{'title': 'Early Token Sale', 'start_date': '2017-10-01T04:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2017-12-20T05:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 5725875682, 'asset_collected': 'ETH', 'price_per_token_in_asset': 8.047602505e-06, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.0032, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 43942.25, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 17472757, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': ['China', 'Japan', 'United States']}, {'title': 'Community Token Sale', 'start_date': '2017-12-27T05:00:00Z', 'type': 'Public', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2018-01-04T05:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 574107038, 'asset_collected': 'ETH', 'price_per_token_in_asset': 9.556527975e-06, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.0038, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 4947, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 1967075.61, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': ['China', 'Japan', 'United Kingdom']}]","[{'name': 'Framework agreement', 'link': 'https://docs.zilliqa.com/Zilliqa-Bitcoin-Suisse-Framework-Agreement.pdf'}, {'name': 'TGE paper (password: ZilliqaTGE17)', 'link': 'https://docs.zilliqa.com/tgepaper.pdf'}, {'name': 'TGE presentation (password: ZilliqaTGE17)', 'link': 'https://docs.zilliqa.com/tgepresentation.pdf'}]","[{'account_type': 'Treasury Ether Wallet', 'asset_held': {'id': 'ETH', 'name': 'Ether'}, 'addresses': [{'name': 'Treasury Ether Wallet', 'link': 'https://etherscan.io/address/0xde5a57b9ba909c332cb7be7133ec29e228fb0286'}], 'security': 'Multi-sig'}]",[],"[{'category': 'Development of the blockchain platform', 'amount_in_percentage': 24.6}, {'category': 'Research on pressing problems', 'amount_in_percentage': 13.7}, {'category': 'Community engagement, bounty programs', 'amount_in_percentage': 4.5}, {'category': 'Collaboration with academia and other projects', 'amount_in_percentage': 4.5}, {'category': 'Operations, equipment, Cloud hosting', 'amount_in_percentage': 13.6}, {'category': 'Marketing & business development', 'amount_in_percentage': 13.6}, {'category': 'Compliance, legal & finance', 'amount_in_percentage': 5.5}, {'category': 'Anquan Capital Pte.

Zilliqa issues new tokens at a fixed inflation rate of ~2% per year. When Zilliqa's mainnet launched in January 2019, block rewards were split into base rewards (25%) for all validating nodes in the network and flexible rewards (70%) that are based on the amount of valid and accepted signatures submitted by a node during a transaction epoch. The last 5% of rewards are allocated to the lookup and seed nodes. The entirety of the Mining rewards are already pre-mined and will be distributed over a ten-year period.

Seed Node Staking Changes
In June 2020, Zilliqa introduced a new staking contract (via ZIP-3), which allows Seed Nodes to distribute their percentage of the block reward to direct or delegate stakers. There were only ten seed nodes when the contract went leive, and each one was eligible to receive enough delegate tokens to stake up to 61 million tokens. Therefore, the number of tokens available for staking in first phase of Zilliqa's new staking contract tops out at 610 million ZIL. 

When ZIP-3 launched, Seed Nodes continued to receive 5% of all block rewards, a portion of which they passed down to delegate stakers in proportion to the number of tokens locked up. But in November 2020, Zilliqa executed ZIP-9 to overhaul the distribution block rewards. Under this new policy, miners only 60% of block rewards while the remaining share goes to Seed Nodes and their delegates. Zilliqa increase the rewards for stakers to incentivize more stakers to join the network. The Zilliqa also increased the block reward by 40% to offset any losses suffered by miners due to the new block reward split. Therefore, the network will now reach its maximum supply much sooner than originally intended.",Inflationary,Fixed Inflation rate,True,21000000000.0,"Zilliqa’s network consists of several groups of nodes, each called a shard. A special shard among these is referred to as a Directory Service (DS) committee. The DS committee acts as a supervisory shard and helps in the formation of shards and aggregate transaction validation results from each shard among others.

Zilliqa leverages on the shards for parallel processing of transactions. Each shard and the DS committee run an optimized practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT) for consensus on valid transactions.

NOTE: In pBFT, there is a deterministic finality of blocks, unlike the probabilistic finality in <a href=""https://messari.io/article/nakamoto-consensus"">Nakamoto consensus</a> (like <a href=""https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin"">$BTC</a>). Therefore, there is no need for several block confirmation, the latest state of the latest block is the “truth” of the chain.

Zilliqa miners receive block rewards based on how many valid signatures they contributed. According to the team, this makes ZIL rewards low-variance and potentially allows for a more equal distribution of tokens by way of block rewards.

Pax's existence as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum allows it to be integrated with Ethereum based applications. ,,,"[{'title': 'Funding Round', 'start_date': '2013-11-13T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Seed Funding Round', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2013-11-13T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': None, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 3300000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Funding Round', 'start_date': '2015-05-08T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Series A Funding Round', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2015-05-08T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': None, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 25000000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Funding Round', 'start_date': '2015-05-31T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Series B Funding Round', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2015-05-31T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': None, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 65000000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Funding Round', 'start_date': '2020-12-06T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Series C Funding Round', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2020-12-06T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': None, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 142000000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}]",[],[],,[],,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': None, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': None, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': None}",,,"There is no cap on the number of Paxos Standard tokens that Paxos can generate.

Excluding the first two Litecoin blocks (which were mined prior to release), coin emission during the first 24 hours was elevated resulting in the creation of 500,000 Litecoin in the first 24 hours. While it is well-documented that Dash inherited the bug from Litecoin, there has nonetheless been widespread speculation about whether the resulting instamine was intentional to benefit early miners.

This ensures that all assets and intellectual property are under permanent control of the network itself, rather than any individual or company. Through on-chain governance (described below), the masternodes elect the trust protectors, who have the authority to direct the trustee to oversee Dash Core Group (e.g., assign the board of directors).  

Proposals generally begin life as simple pre-proposal forum posts on the Dash Forum, where feedback and suggestions are solicited from the general community. Once the proposal owner decides they have a reasonable chance of passing their proposal, it is created as a governance object on the blockchain. A fee of 5 DASH is associated with this action to prevent spam and ensure only serious proposals make it to this stage. Several tools exist to allow masternode operators to comfortably review and vote on proposals. The net total of yes votes must exceed 10% of the total masternode count at the time votes are tallied in order to pass. If there are more passing proposals than the available block reward can provide for, the proposals with the most yes votes will pass first, creating a cut-off point for less popular proposals. The same process is then repeated every month, and the total amount of Dash available for proposals decreases by approximately 7.14% per year, together with the overall block reward.  

Websites, such as DashCentral, Dash Nexus, and Dash Ninja are available to monitor progress over time and gather more detailed statistics. Dash Masternode Tool also allows for voting without the need to share masternode private keys with a third party service.  

Each proposal includes a description of the proposal goals, details of what work will be done and a breakdown of the requested budget. Many proposals also link to their own website or the pre-proposal discussion, or include a video to validate the identity and sincerity of the proposal owner. Discussion on DashCentral and/or Dash Nexus occurs below this information, and masternode owners have the option to verify their ownership of a masternode and ability to cast a vote by signing a message from the masternode collateral address. Masternodes can vote at any time, and also change their vote at any time until the cutoff block is mined and voting stops. This occurs 1662 blocks prior to the superblock. After voting stops, the blockchain executes a decentralized tally and validates all votes. Once consensus is reached, the results are broadcast and the budget is allocated soon after in a superblock.  

Once passed, proposals are able to report back to the network on the Dash Forum or via published public channels and social media. Since it is possible to create proposals that pay out over several months, it is also possible to revoke funding from a project by changing the vote if development or spending of already allocated funds is unsatisfactory. This encourages proposal owners to work honestly and diligently to win the trust and approval of the network. Ongoing discussion and gradual improvement over time results in a close bond between the network and those working for the network in supporting roles.  

Voting on proposals is updated in real time via P2P messages and stored by Dash in cache files, so current winning proposals and the total allocation of the available budget are always open and visible to everyone.   

Finally, Dash Watch (which was itself funded through a budget proposal) exists to monitor the ability of blockchain contractors to deliver on their promises with respect to delivery dates and the total amounts of budget allocated over multiple voting periods. A team of dedicated staff routinely interact with proposal owners to track progress of the various projects and provide reports to voting masternodes in a single location. While providing data on the performance of a proposal to Dash Watch is optional, many masternode owners take advantage of the data they make available to make a voting decision.",Direct On-Chain Vote,"Decentralized Governance by Blockchain, or DGBB, is Dash’s attempt to solve two important problems in cryptocurrency: governance and funding. Governance in a decentralized project is difficult, because by definition there are no central authorities to make decisions for the project. In Dash, such decisions are made by the network, that is, by the owners of masternodes. The DGBB system allows each masternode to cast a vote (yes/no/abstain) on each proposal. Proposals are most often regarding the allocation of the network's funding. If a proposal passes, the payment specified by the proposal is paid in a monthly ""superblock"" along with all the passing proposals that month. Decision proposals are occasionally submitted to the network for important or contentious decision. For example, the outcome of a vote can be used to determine whether a feature should be implemented (or not) by Dash’s developers. A key example is early in 2016, when Dash’s Core Team submitted a proposal to the network asking whether the blocksize should be increased to 2 MB. Within 24 hours, consensus had been reached to approve this change. Compare this to Bitcoin, where debate on the blocksize has been raging for nearly three years and has resulted in serious splits within the community and even forks to the Bitcoin blockchain.  

The DGBB also provides a means for Dash to fund its own development. While other projects have to depend on donations or premined endowments, Dash uses 10% of the block reward to fund its own development. Every time a block is mined, 45% of the reward goes to the miner, 45% goes to a masternode, and the remaining 10% is not created until the end of the month. During the month, anyone can submit a budget proposal to the network. If that proposal earns the net approval of at least 10% of the masternode network, then at the end of the month the requested amount will be paid out in the “superblock”.

It distributed 1.575 billion (12.5% of supply) via the initial exchange offering event on Binance Launchpad. Harmony allocated 16.9% of the total supply for the Harmony team and an additional 22.4% of the total supply for protocol development. Ecosystem development receives 21.8% of the total supply. The remaining tokens went to the Seed token sale and Node Round participants.

For ongoing staking rewards, Harmony's economics model caps the annual issuance at 441 million tokens (about a 3% rate in long term). This model aims to give validators a predictable return. Harmony also burns all transaction fees in an effort to lessen the inflationary impact of a fixed annual issuance. The Liquid Supply Curve does not reflect future tokens burned as this number is less predictable.",Inflationary,Fixed Issuance,,,"Harmony combines a Practical BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerant) system for consensus with a variation of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to prevent Sybil attacks. In the network's PoS system, known as Effective PoS, the validators who stake the most tokens receive a slot in the overall Validator Set, which currently consists of 640 community-run nodes.

The effective stake design economically discourages single validators that control a significant number of staked tokens, whereas lower-ranked validators (in terms of stake weight) receive an extra reward. This model aims to prevent the centralization of staked towards the top of the Validator Set.

The Harmony protocol also includes built-in penalties to punish undesired validator behavior, such as double-signing or falling offline when called upon.
Double Signing: A validator that gets caught double-signing a proposed block will receive a minimum 2% slashing penalty on their stake. The slashing increases linearly as the number of validators being slashed at the same time (e.g. 33% slashing if 1/3 of the validators double signing)
Unavailability: At the end of each epoch, validators that couldn't maintain at least a 67% uptime will have their status set to “Inactive” and be ruled out from the new election. No slashing is applied to unavailable validators.

Harmony uses Boneh–Lynn–Shacham (BLS) constant-sized signatures to commit blocks in a single round of consensus messages.

Validator requirements
Hardware requirements include a dual-core CPU with 4GB of RAM memory
Validator documentation",Proof-of-Stake,Effective Proof-of-Stake,8.0,,,,,,"At the moment, the company behind Harmony's development is coordinating product releases and protocol chain in an off-chain manner. Improvement proposals are open-source, allowing community members to view and provide feedback on the proposed changes. For example, Harmony already completed its first off-chain governance decision, when the team and the community agreed to speed up the increase in Validator slots. In the long term, however, the project would like to transition to an on-chain governance model. ",Upcoming,"One of Harmony's goals for 2020 is [to create and transition to](https://docs.harmony.one/home/governance) an on-chain governance model for proposing and implementing protocol changes. This new system would aim to shift control of the protocol from the founders and the Foundation to community validators and token holders.

An on-chain governance system will become a possibility once all validator slots are open to community participation (the Harmony Foundation still maintains a few hundred nodes). Further updates on Harmony's on-chain governance model should be available later in 2020.",,,

The token will be used to pay for transactions, and new mina will be minted to pay block producers for creating new blocks. This incentive mechanism will be critical for the various participants to co-ordinate and work together in a decentralized manner.

Besides being the network’s native token, minas may be used to transfer value, act as collateral, or anything that a digitally-native store of value is capable of. O(1) Labs envisions the token being used in novel, yet-to-be-imagined ways by applications built upon the protocol.",Private Sale,"o(1) labs raised $3.5 million in seed funding in May 2018 to begin the development of Mina (then called Coda Protocol), as well as a follow-on round of $15 million in April 2019. The network is has been in a public testnet phase since mid-2019. The team plans to launch a mainnet version of Mina before the end of 2020.

On March 24th, 2020, Mina launched Genesis, a token program that prepares participants to become the network’s first block producers and ensures high decentralization upon mainnet launch.

1,000 Genesis founding members will be selected to receive a distribution of 66,000 Mina tokens by completing challenges on the testnet to help strengthen the network. When the mainnet goes live, Genesis founding members will comprise the network’s initial block producers, because they will have the knowledge required to stake tokens.

Mina is setting aside up to 6.7% of tokens for Genesis founding members. Izaak Meckler, CTO & Co-founder, said: “The Genesis program allows us to build a community of engaged members who are helping to set the rules of the ecosystem. Such engagement is essential for constructing an infrastructure that serves the needs of its members.”

Then, over the course of the first five years, the inflation rate will fall to 7%, and remain at 7% thereafter by default, subject to changes via the chain’s governance.

Importantly, the protocol will target these inflation rates regardless of the staking participation rate. That means that block rewards will change dynamically to target this inflation rate. For example, if only 50% of the network stakes, then block rewards will double. This is because per Ouroboros, number of blocks produced per epoch is expected to be proportional to the staking ratio.

The block reward was initially set at 31.19582664 DCR and halves every 6,144 blocks (approximately 21 days). The reward reduction rate is set at 100/101. Block rewards are allocated to three distinct groups: 
60% is allocated to the Proof-of-Work miner 
30% is allocated to the Proof-of-Stake voters. Each of the 5 voters receive 6% of the block reward
10% is allocated to the Decred Treasury

If a block includes less than 5 Proof-of-Stake votes, a fraction of the block reward is not allocated. As a result, the maximum supply only indicates an upper limit for the total number of decred which will ever be created, as the actual precise issuance depends on how many Proof-of-Stake votes are included in each block.

Decred employs a hybrid <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work"">proof-of-work</a> (PoW) <a href=""https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake"">proof-of-stake</a> (PoS) consensus model that can be thought of in layers. The first layer is powered by <a href=""https://messari.io/article/nakamoto-consensus"">Nakamoto Consensus</a>, whereby the valid chain is the longest chain with the most accumulated PoW. The second layer is powered by PoS, whereby stakers validate blocks before appending them to the blockchain. The PoS layer acts as a check on miners, ensuring they do not submit deliberately empty or invalid blocks. The PoS layer is also used for Decred's governance process (see governance section for more detail).

In order to participate in PoS consensus one must stake DCR to receive tickets, a non-tradable cryptoasset on the Decred network. Up 20 new tickets are available for purchase each block, with the price of tickets adjusting dynamically every 144 blocks (~12 hours). The price of tickets adjusts in order to keep the Ticket Pool, total number of tickets on the Decred network, near the target pool size of 40,960 tickets. This is done to aid predictability in staking activity, so stakers need not worry about drastically fluctuating parameters that determine how frequently you get to participate in consensus.

Each block 5 tickets are randomly selected by a Poisson distribution to validate blocks produced by POW miners, and vote on Decred governance proposals during voting periods. The average time it takes for a ticket to vote is 28 days, but possibly requiring up to 142 days, with a 0.5% chance of expiring before being chosen to vote (this expiration returns the original Ticket Price without a reward).

Mining
Miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks using the BLAKE-256 proof-of-work algorithm. In this process, miners compete to generate a <a href=""https://messari.io/blog/hash-function"">hash</a> less than the target number set by Decred's <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level"">difficulty adjustment algorithm</a>. The target difficulty level is adjusted every 144 blocks (~12 hours).

Although open to anyone with a CPU, Decred mining is now dominated by <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics"">ASICs</a>. In order to smooth individual miner revenue as mining has become more competitive, mining is now done in pools where participants contribute <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/hash-power"">hash power</a> to the pool and receive a proportional share of the profits if the pool finds a valid block.

The Decred block reward reduces by a factor of 100/101 every 6,144 blocks (approximately 21.33 days). Furthermore, the Decred block reward is allocated 60% to miners, 30% to stakers, and 10% to the Decred decentralized treasury. ",Hybrid PoW & PoS,,300.0,,BLAKE-256,,False,,"Decred was deliberately designed prevent powerful individuals or central planning committees from gaining a disproportionate influence over the future of the project. Decred governance has its foundations in the Decred constitution - a set of principles and guidelines that provide users a clear understanding of the social contract between themselves and the project. 

The Decred governance system is designed to allow the Decred community to decide upon anything ranging from protocol changes to decentralized treasury allocations. Governance in Decred works through a combination of on-chain and off-chain mechanisms. All Decred governance decisions are legitimized via its on-chain governance system; however, off-chain, is where the governance process begins.

Politeia
Every Decred governance proposal begin on Politeia (Pi). Politeia is a web platform that supports facilitates the submission, tracking, and discussion of Decred governance proposals by the stakeholder community. Anyone is free to submit new proposals for consideration. Once submitted proposals are reviewed by Politeia admins where they can censor spam proposals. However, to ensure transparency over what's being censored, All data on Politeia is periodically anchored into the Decred blockchain, using dcrtime, and users can prove censorship cryptographically if censorship occurs. Valid proposals appear publicly on Politeia, where discussion and revision take place. Once a proposal owner is confident in their proposal they can authorize voting on it. Owners authorize voting on their proposals by paying a 0.1 DCR fee. Once voting is authorized the on-chain governance process begins.

Consensus Rule Voting
For governance proposals related to consensus rule changes, the process begins, like every proposal, with the Politeia system. Initial proposals for consensus changes are brought to life through the Politeia system in order to determine if the work necessary to create a working implementation, its associated Decred Change Proposal (DCP), and an on-chain vote for the rule change should be performed. Once a proposal has successfully gone through the Politea system, it then begins life as a DCP. DCPs are similar to <a href=""https://messari.io/article/bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip"">BIPs</a> in Bitcoin. DCPs are design documents describing protocol or consensus changes to Decred. After a DCP is written new software which implements the proposed change developed and released. Once released the on-chain governance process begins. ",Direct On-Chain Vote,"__Politeia__
Once a proposal is authorized a ticket-voting interval of 2,016 (~1 week) begins. To start, a snapshot of the live ticket pool is taken at 256 blocks prior to the start of voting. Every ticket in the pool when this snapshot was taken can vote ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ on the proposal. If a ticket is called to vote on-chain during the ticket-voting interval (to validate blocks or vote on consensus rule changes), it still has until the end of the ticket-voting interval to vote on the proposal. When the voting period ends, a proposal is formally approved or rejected. In order for a vote to be considered valid there must be a quorum of 20% of the eligible tickets who vote ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. The threshold for a proposal to be approved is 60% ‘Yes’ votes. If the proposal has a budget and deliverables attached to it the proposal owner can submit claims against the budget as deliverables are completed.

__Consensus Rule Voting__
Once new software is released both PoW miners and PoS voters must independently adopt the software with the code changes; however, the code changes will lie dormant until the change has been voted upon.The voting period is activated once a target adoption threshold is reach for the PoW miners and PoS voters. The PoW upgrade is consdiered complete once 95% of the latest 1,000 blocks are mined with the latest version. The PoS upgrade is considered complete once 75% of the votes in a complete [stake version interval](https://docs.decred.org/glossary/#stake-version-interval-svi) (An interval which is used to determine if a vote on consensus rule changes can begin which occurs every 2,016 blocks or ~1 week) are cast using the latest version. Once both thresholds are met, voting is scheduled to begin on the first block of the next [rule change interval](https://docs.decred.org/glossary/#rule-change-interval-rci) (an interval in which ticket holders can vote on consensus rule changes that occurs every 8,064 blocks or ~4 weeks). 

Once the voting period begins, ticket holders vote on the changes over a rule change interval. Every vote has a quorum requirement of 10% (voters who are not abstaining). If that requirement is met, a 75% ""Yes"" or ""No"" majority threshold is required for a vote to pass. If the outcome is ""Yes"", the consensus changes will automatically update 8,064 blocks after the vote passed. All participants in the Decred network must upgrade their software to the latest version during this window. If the outcome is ""No"", the consensus changes will never active. If the majority threshold is not met the consensus rule change will remain active for the next rule change interval. If it fails to reach an outcome again the consensus change will expire and never activate. ",True,,

Arweave intends to use Proof of Access for its blockweave data structure to prove data is stored securely over time within its network. Proof of Access randomly selects a prior block – termed the recall block – and mandates that miners are able to provide specific data from the recall block (e.g. the block list hash). This process occurs for each block in the blockweave structure.

Mining
Miners are compensated from mining block from two sources – inflation and transaction fees.

During the blockweave block creation process, if a miner is unable to access the data from the selected “recall block”, the miner is not permitted to verify the new block or claim the block reward. Arweave claims that this will incentivize miners to store as much information/blocks of the Arweave protocol as possible.

Each transaction to store data immediately uses a portion of the user's AR token to pay the transaction fee while the rest is held in a network endowment which is used to pay the cost of storage in perpetuity. Prior to joining the Arweave network, all miners must download the most recent block which contains the hash list and wallet list (see technology section).

In some cases, a miner can be compensated by a third source – a reward from the existing storage endowment.",Other,Proof of Access,,,,,,,The Arweave protocol supports a blacklist system by which any node has the option to blacklist content that an individual or group of nodes wishes to reject. Content that is rejected by more than half the network will be rejected across the entire network.,,,,,

Initially, Andre had the exclusive ability to mint tokens but that privilege was later extended to 9 multi-sig owners requiring 6 signatures. These members are active members in the DeFi community and Andre did not include himself as a signatory.

Users must stake their YFI in the governance pool in order to vote and claim for earnings. In the early stage of the project, the voting process is 100% on-chain where the user commits YFI for 3 days in a voting contract. In September 2020, due to high gas prices, the governance opted to vote on Snapshot, a voting client that uses no gas. The voting mechanism essentially checks whether the voter has YFI in their wallet. 
",Direct On-Chain Vote,"YFI token holders can submit and vote on proposals to govern the system. Proposals that meet quorum requirements (>20% of the tokens staked in the governance contract) and generate majority support (>50% of the vote) are implemented by a 9 member multi-signature wallet. The changes must be formalized by 6/9 multi-signers before implementation. The multi-signers are also voted in by YFI holders. The number of multi-signers and quorum requirements are subject to change to governance parameters.

Each Proof-of-Work (PoW) chain mines the same currency and contains references (Merkle root subsets) to their peer chains’ previous block, thus peer chains can validate each other’s blocks, and share liquidity. This approach differs from sidechains, as every individual chain has the same capabilities as the main chain.

Chainweb is designed to increase transaction throughput linearly as new chains are added in parallel to the network. Miners target each chain individually, which lessens Kadena’s mempool bottleneck relative to Bitcoin. From a security and continuity perspective, chains include a hash of their sister chains' the Merkle roots and inspect the roots to validate that the branches do not diverge. This design helps independent Kadena chains to achieve a single view of transaction history across chains. The cross-referencing of Merkle roots also serves to increase hostile-fork resistance. To relace a given block, an attack must fork every chain in the network, or, in other words, attain the cumulative hash power of every running chain.

Additional security is defined by the Merkle cone for a given block, a novel feature unique to the Kadena blockchain. Merkle cones describe what past transactions are provable and how a transaction becomes provable to the network, ideally in a trust minimized manner, as new layers are formed. In short, the Merkle cone defines the total amount of work needed to replace a past block or double-spend a past transaction.",Proof-of-Work,,30.0,2.3,Blake2s,,,,,No On-Chain Governance,,,,

Audius tokens exist to align governance and financial incentives that increase protocol usage and create long term protocol value.

$AUDIO has three prongs of functionality within the protocol unlocked by staking: 

1) Security 
2) Feature access 
3) Governance

Audius tokens are staked as collateral for value added services. In exchange, stakers earn ongoing issuance, governance weight and access to exclusive features. Audius tokens are staked by node operators to run the Audius protocol, and by artists and curators to unlock exclusive features and services. Any $AUDIO staked within the protocol is assigned governance weight, used to shape future iterations of the protocol. Audius tokens will serve as collateral for artist-based tooling as well.

Early examples incubated by the community include artists tokens, badges and earnings multipliers. In the future, fans may delegate tokens to specific artists and curators to share in their growth on the platform and the issuance of future tokens.

Node operators must stake Audius tokens to operate a discovery node or content node, with a larger stake correlating to a higher probability of being chosen by 4 fan clients. Node operators receive direct upside from seeding in the form of $AUDIO and the possibility for future protocol fees for actively seeding the protocol.

A community goal, via governance, is to ensure that Audius tokens are always being funneled to the most value-added actors by using onchain metrics as a measurement, rather than simply to those staking the most tokens but not actively participating in the ecosystem.

Stablecoin Payments
The Audius community may choose to leverage 3rd-party stablecoins to unlock paid content.This makes it easy for artists to set custom rates and for fans to issue fractional payments with little friction or rounding. A protocol fee may be captured as a percent of stablecoin transactions, including fan payments to artists. These fees would be aggregated into a pool governed by Audius token holders.

Artist Tokens
Artists could have the ability to distribute a unique token directly through Audius, giving fans who hold a specified amount of those tokens the ability to access exclusive content. Artist token artists stake Audius token to access distribution tools and may receive tailored support from Audius representatives on best practices regarding the usage of their token in the wider Ethereum ecosystem.

Audius serves as an aggregator of artist tokens across issuance platforms such as Roll, Zora and Rally—any interoperable token can be allocated with the protocolnative distribution mechanisms.","Airdrop, Private Sale","Token Sale

Everything in Audius is governable, and all Audius tokens staked in the protocol automatically receives governance weight on a 1 token, 1 vote basis.

Audius politicians differ in the sense that node operators are unique from artists and curators, both of which are aligned in the growth of the protocol.

For node operators, Audius governance acts as a key tool to empower decentralized content storage, providing a direct mechanism for rewards to be earned and amended in line with the costs, value and consensus of other providers on the network.

There is a short-circuit process that allows both 1) proposals to be passed without broader vote if urgency requires, eg. during active exploitation of a vulnerability in the protocol, and 2) proposals to be vetoed if they are not consistent with the philosophies.",,,,,

In 2018, Oasis Labs raised $45 million in a Series A round led by a16z crypto, with participation from Polychain Capital, Pantera, and MetaStable, among others. Oasis sold approximately 2.3 billion ROSE tokens in this VC round or 23% of the network's max supply.

Initial Supply Distribution
At launch, the network will distribute roughly 8.05 billion ROSE tokens to existing stakeholders, founders, and community reserves. The breakdown of these allocations (as a percentage of the maximum supply) is as follows:
Backers: 23.0%
Community & Ecosystem: 22.5%
Core Contributors: 20.0%
Foundation Endowment: 10.0%
Strategic Partners & Reserve: 5.0%

The Oasis Network will distribute the remaining 19.5% as staking rewards to validators and delegators for securing the chain.

Tokens can be self-delegated directly by each node operator or delegated to a node operator by other token holders. While the Oasis Network is designed with a modular architecture (by way of the Cosmos SDK) that can use any consensus system that satisfies these properties, it currently uses Tendermint as its consensus algorithm.

Validators must stake a minimum of 100 tokens to contribute to the network's security. Each entity can have at most one node elected to the consensus committee at a time. Oasis Labs expects 70-100 validators to participate in the network's consensus committee at launch. The chance of being selected for the committee will be proportional to a validator's stake weight (self-staked amount plus delegated stake).

Staking Rewards Details
At launch, the network will target an inflation rate between 2% and 15%, with validator reward amounts dependent on the length of time staked. In order to be eligible for staking rewards per epoch, a node would need to sign at least 75% of blocks in that epoch.

The network will only slash for double-signing at launch. Double-signing penalties will result in the loss of the minimum stake amount (100 tokens) and will also freeze the node. Freezing the node is a precaution in order to prevent the node from being over-penalized. The Network will not slash for liveness or uptime at launch. Oasis will also require a 14-day unbonding period should validators or delegators choose to move their staked funds. During this time, staked tokens are at risk of getting slashed for double-signing and do not accrue rewards during this time.

Consensus Voting Power
The current voting power mechanism is stake-weighted. This means that the consensus voting power of a validator is proportional to its stake. In this model, the network will require signatures by validators representing greater than two-thirds of the total stake of the committee to sign a block. Note that in Tendermint, a validator's opportunities to propose a block in the round-robin block proposer order are also proportional to its voting power.",Proof-of-Stake,Tendermint BFT,,,,,,,The Oasis Protocol Foundation has proposed to use a representative democracy governance model based on a combination of off-chain and on-chain processes for submitting and approving network changes. The Foundation intends to guide the long-term development of the network and coordinate community initiatives. Community members will be allowed to submit input or improvement proposals that will eventually be voted on by Oasis validators as part of the network's upcoming on-chain governance system.,Upcoming,"Oasis plans to incorporate an on-chain governance system to complement its off-chain proposal submission process. This on-chain system will enable validators and delegators to vote on network changes, with voting power based proportionally on stake weight.",False,,

Qtum uses the lock-up and delayed reward as a safety feature to make it difficult for a bad actor to attack the network.",Inflationary,Decreasing Issuance,True,107822406.0,"Qtum's PoS design
Qtum uses an adaptation of Blackcoin’s version of Proof-of-Stake protocol (PoS) to secure the network and achieve consensus. In short, validators stake tokens (i.e. lock up tokens in escrow) in order to validate transactions and produce blocks. The likelihood of being chosen to produce a block is proportional to the number of tokens one has staked on the network (each new coin staked reduces the difficulty of producing the next block to a point). By design, PoS incorporates a slashing penalty (i.e., coin confiscation) to disincentivize participants form trying to game the system. Qtum opted for PoS because it believes PoW is energy-intensive, wasteful, and unsustainable. 

Coin maturity
Unlike some other PoS chains, Qtum does not have a minimum staking requirements. This strategy can encourage widespread participation (thus increasing the decentralization of validators), but it means consensus participants have less of an incentive to remain honest. Qtum addresses this challenge through its coin maturity mechanism, which requires staking tokens to ""mature"" (i.e., staked for at least 500 blocks) to participate in block production and receive staking rewards.

The Qtum network produces a 2 MB block every 120 seconds (two minutes). Each block rewards the validator with a total of 4 newly minted QTUM, but these stakers only receive 0.4 QTUM once the block is created. The protocol locks the remaining 3.6 QTUM until the initial 0.4 reward has reached maturity (which, as mentioned, takes 500 blocks). After maturing, the validator receives the rest of the inflation reward in incremental payouts over nine blocks.",Proof-of-Stake,,120.0,4.0,n/a,2021-10-27T04:00:00Z,False,,"While Qtum features an on-chain governance system for managing specific network parameters, its also has an off-chain process for approving and carrying out more significant protocol changes. These types of upgrades, which include adding new features like a VM, would require a network fork to implement.

The Qtum Chain Foundation also plays a critical role in the development and general direction of the Qtum blockchain. It help manage the Qtum code base and oversee the creation and implementation of new network features.",Direct On-Chain Vote,"Qtum has implemented an on-chain governance system, which it calls the Decentralized Governance Protocol (DGP), for carrying out changes to specific network parameters. These parameters under the purview of DGP include block size and the base cost of gas fees. Participants bear the responsibility of approving these adjustments by using their QTUM tokens to either signal support or dissatisfaction with a proposal. DGP will be able to issue approved changes via a soft fork (whenever possible), thereby preventing any network disruptions often seen during hard fork upgrades. More significant upgrades that would require a hard fork to implement would instead go through Qtum's off-chain governance process.

There are four steps to the DGP process:

1. A network participant or group of stakeholders creates a proposal that aims to change a specific network parameter
2. All governance participants vote on the proposal
3. If accepted, the network will automatically implement the change. A rejection will keep the network running as is.
4. All proposal data is then archived

As the network transitions to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validation, only holders of OMG token will be able to gain the right to take an active role on the network by running validator nodes using their tokens as a security deposit. Accordingly, token holders participating in PoS validation may receive compensation for their active participation as a validator - which may be paid out in any currency, including but not limited to OMG. 

More generally, OMG is intended to be a conduit for bringing value to Ethereum mainnet as the token will be backed by the assets moving across the OMG Network. These assets include both real-world currencies and cryptocurrencies that users push through the network via a variety of means including Defi applications and businesses, as well as all who outsource DEX requirements to OMG Network.

Participants have to stake, spend or burn IOTX to execute transactions, partake in on-chain governance, register a decentralized identity (DID) for human users and devices, and implement other network transactions.

Gas Fees: Analogous to L1 blockchains, users have to spend gas fees to execute contracts and transactions, in proportion to the processing capacity required by the contract/transaction. A  factor that distinguishes IoTeX from other L1 blockchains is the ability of both human users and machines to initiate transactions, access smart contracts, send payments and charge for services. 

Burn-to-Certify: Every human and machine user of IoTeX is assigned a decentralized identity (DID), an on-chain identification credential, which enables trusted human-machine interactions. A majority of devices can get a DID for free, however, device manufacturers have to burn IOTX to be assigned a DID and a ""Powered by IoTeX"" (PBI) certificate. PBI devices have a monthly allocation of zero gas fees, while other devices would have to pay gas for every transaction. The burn-to-certify utility has a deflationary design as the total supply of IOTX decreases as more PBI devices join the network.

Governance: IOTX facilitates governance in IoTeX's decentralized ecosystem, and token holders can stake their IOTX to vote on proposals and to elect Delegates. Delegates are participants elected to manage consensus (block production) and upgrades on the entire network. While only Delegates can manage consensus, IOTX stakers can vote on various proposals such as network parameters, protocol upgrades and many more. The weight of a staker's vote is proportional to the amount staked.

Stake-to-Service: To offer developers a more flexible, robust and functional experience, IoTeX encourages the participation of third-party service providers with specialities in capabilities not offered by the platform. These service providers are required to purchase permission to offer their services on the network by staking IOTX. Also, service level agreements (SLAs) would be defined by the service providers and failure to meet the quality/availability guarantees specified by the SLA will result in the slashing of the service provider's stake.",Private Sale,"A private ICO round, which began in January and ended on 14 February 2018, was held for about 50 accredited investors only due to regulatory reasons.

Instead of a central order book, Bancor fulfills trades between users and cryptoasset reserves called liquidity pools. Tokens in a liquidity pool are matched with a proportionate BNT amount to create pairs. The BNT serves as a common price among all unique tokens which creates markets for two otherwise illiquid tokens.

Fixed Reserve Ratio
The BNT smart contract controls BNT supply in proportion to each token according to its Fixed Reserve Ratio, or FRR. The FRR remains constant to ensure the token price in BNT reflects supply and demand on the Bancor exchange. When a given token is purchased from the exchange, the paired BNT amount is burned from the supply to maintain the FRR. When the exchange receives a new token, new BNT is minted to maintain the FRR. The BancorDAO determines and documents the FRR so token prices are continuously and transparently updated.

LP Fees
Liquidity pools are created by liquidity provider, or LP deposits. These deposits accrue trading fees to the LP according to their share of the pool's total liquidity. Users pay trading fees as a percentage of their trade value. While the user pays fees in the traded token, the protocol converts the fee into a proportionate amount of the traded token and its BNT pair. Trading fees are then distributed to LPs in either the traded token or BNT according to the asset they deposited in the pool.

Elastic Supply
Bancor V2.1 made BNT supply elastic. Previously, BNT supply changed only when tokens were traded on the exchange. Deposits from LPs into liquidity pools required a proportionate amount of the token and BNT. Now, LPs can make single-sided deposits, and the BNT smart contract mints or burns BNT according to the FRR. Additionally, BNT is burned when an LP adds BNT to any pool. This burn function is designed to put deflationary pressure on BNT supply as asset values increase.

Each trade results in at least two transactions, a debit and a credit of the traded tokens into their respective liquidity pools. Bancor's AMM adjusts the BNT supply in each token's liquidity pool to maintain the pair's price according to the Fixed Reserve Rate, or FRR. For tokens credited into a liquidity pool, new BNT is minted and stored in the pool. When tokens are debited, matching BNT tokens are burned, or permanently removed from the total BNT supply.

If a user provides an asset to a pool, they create no debit transaction. In this case, BNT supply grows with the new BNT minted into the liquidity pool. If a user later supplies BNT to the same pool, the protocol burns the same amount of BNT from the pool to maintain the supply of BNT according to the AMM algorithm.

Connector Weight
Token prices on the Bancor exchange adjust according to Bancor's AMM algorithm. A token's price is a function of the total supply relative to the BNT supply and price-weighted by a Connector Weight, or CW, factor. Holders of BNT decide the CW that determines how sensitively the token's price adjusts as its supply changes within the Bancor protocol. Bancor V2.1 introduced new functionality that adjusts BNT supply relative to a token's supply, according to the CW algorithm. This new provision eliminated the requirement for traders and LPs to convert a proportionate amount of their transaction tokens into BNT.",Crowdsale,"Bancor launched its Initial Coin Offering, or ICO, on June 12, 2017. A total of 10,885 participants participated in the three-hour sale with an average purchase size of $13,471. Overall, 79.3 million BNT tokens were created. Token sale participants received 50% of the total supply or 39.7 million BNT.

The remaining 39.7 million BNT was distributed to:

Any LP deposit required BNT to accompany a given token according to the token's AMM function. Most BNT was added to the exchange from LP deposits and trades. The initial BNT supply was not fixed but did not change significantly relative to the total supply of tokens added to the exchange's liquidity pools.

A token's AMM function dynamically sets the price in BNT - the rate at which the token can be converted to BNT. The ratio is determined when the BancorDAO votes to whitelist the token on the exchange. The price is the result of the total token supply divided by the total BNT supply weighted by the Connector Weight, or CW percentage from 0% to 100%. The CW affects the token's price sensitivity relative to changes in the outstanding token and BNT supplies. A CW approaching 100% creates a flat price curve, effectively pegging BNT to the token.

Version 2.1 made BNT supply elastic. The protocol uses each token's CW formula to mint or burn BNT supply to maintain a constant CW as the token supply changes. This allows LPs to supply liquidity pools with only their intended asset, rather than both assets in proportion. This also allows the protocol to return LP deposits at or above the value they deposited because the protocol can mint new BNT to compensate for price differences that occurred.

Each LP token deposit into a liquidity pool is matched with minted BNT according to the pricing algorithm. For a trade, BNT is minted in proportion with the token received and stored in the token's liquidity pool. Any BNT LP deposit into the same pool would replace the same amount of BNT previously minted by the protocol. If the pool contains only LP-added BNT and no protocol-minted BNT remained, the pool would be closed for additional BNT deposits until more tokens were added and BNT minted.

As tokens are debited from a liquidity pool, BNT is burned according to the pricing algorithm. When a user receives tokens, the corresponding amount of BNT is burned to maintain the CW. Whenever an LP deposits BNT into any pool, the same amount of BNT minted by the protocol is burned from the pool.

Instead, an initial allocation of LPT was distributed at genesis to the community, to then be used to stake as transcoder or delegator.

For the token generation and distribution, a Merkle mine process was used. In this process, users generate LPT by submitting a Merkle proof that proves they were part of the genesis state, meaning they had at least 0.1 ETH in their account at a specific block number. In the initial period, which started on May 1, 2018, and was known as the 'slow start', users could only submit their own proofs and generate their own tokens.

Subsequently, starting on July 26, 2018, 3rd party mining began where users could submit proofs on behalf of other users who had not generated their token yet, in order to distribute the remaining available LPT. The tokens generated were split amongst the user submitting the proof (caller) and the user for whom the proof was submitted (receiver), according to an algorithm that over time increased the proportion awarded to the caller. The initial distribution was completed on October 2, 2018, with all 6,343,700 of the genesis LPT distributed.

In addition to the 6,343,700 LPT distributed to the community, 1,235,000 LPT was retained by the founders and early team (vesting over 36 months), 1,900,000 LPT was sold in a pre-sale (vesting over 18 months), 500,000 LPT was put in a long term development fund and 21,300 was issued as a grant to a couple of early advisors and contributors. 

LPT is inflationary as additional LPT is minted on an ongoing basis to function as a reward for the verification and transcoding work undertaken by transcoders. The token issuance will follow an inflationary schedule set in the protocol. As such, participation in the network, either through transcoding or through delegation is needed in order to not be inflated away. See more details about the merkle mine and initial distribution.

Developers purchase independent blockchains, or SKALE S-Chains, with SKL tokens to run their dApps. SKL tokens are also used for delegating and staking to secure the network. Stakers and delegators earn rewards in exchange for locking their holdings on the network.

ERC777 is an Ethereum-based token standard that is backward compatible with the more popular ERC20 standard, meaning that all Ethereum apps with ERC20 support can also support ERC777 tokens. This newer standard aims to improve upon some of the shortcomings of ERC20, particularly its inability to use a token as a trigger for a function of another smart contract. One disadvantage of ERC777standards is that creating a new ERC777 token contract can be relatively expensive in terms of gas costs.

The SKALE Network is able to use SKL for both staking and delegation due to functions support by the ERC777 standard. Unlike with ERC-20, a delegator using SKL does not need to send tokens to a separate delegation smart contract. Instead, they can share their secure delegation key with a staking provider while storing the tokens in a cold or hot wallet.",Private Sale,"Early venture round
The project raised a total of $16.9 million from private investors to fund its pre-production development. The funding includes a $9 million contribution from SKALE Labs, which used the capital it raised in previous SAFT sales to support the SKALE Network. These sales combined to purchase 25.5% of the max SKL supply and were subject to investor lockup periods ranging from 6-36 months based on the individual SAFT agreements.

Activate's Proof of Use
The SKALE token (SKL) was the first to launch on Activate, which provided a platform for public distribution of tokens and participation in SKALE's network. ConsenSys has pioneered a new feature, Proof-of-Use.
Proof of Use requires users who claim or purchase tokens during the launch to actively “prove use” before they’re allowed to transfer or redeem them for alternative purposes 
For example, a participant may be required to delegate their purchased tokens for 60 days before being able to transfer them outside the network 
Distributing tokens amongst stakeholders with aligned incentives is critical to minimize passive speculation while ensuring networks are effectively bootstrapped at launch

3,736 people from 90 different countries purchased 168,553,209 SKL at $0.03 USD/SKL, all of whom helped secure the network ahead of SKALE's Phase 2 mainnet launch on Oct. 1, 2020.

Remaining allocations
SKALE has also allocated 10% of the max supply to the N.O.D.E. Foundation, the non-profit entity created to support the future development of the network. These tokens will vest over a seven-year period following SKALE's mainnet launch.

The team dedicated the remaining tokens 20% of the max to SKALE Labs, with the majority going to the founding team. The team's tokens will remain locked for the first year and will then vest over the following three years.

All vesting periods will commence at launch.","[{'title': 'Seed Round', 'start_date': '2018-09-01T04:00:00Z', 'type': 'Seed', 'details': 'This Seed Sale represents the cumulative investment into SKALE Labs Inc. prior to the creation of the SKALE Foundation asset transfer and SAFT conversion.

SKALE Validator details can be found here and here.

SKALE Node Details
The SKALE Network has a set of validators securing the network. Validators provide computation power to the SKALE Network by deploying nodes. The collection of validators and the node(s) they spin up represent the entire validator network that performs work for SKALE Chains (Elastic Sidechain aka SKALE Chain).
‍
SKALE Chains in the network are operated by a group of virtual sub-nodes selected from a subset of nodes (validators) in the network and are run on all or a subset (multi-tenancy) of each node’s computation and storage resources. As each node in the network continues to participate in their assigned SKALE Chains, they are awarded bounties based upon their performance at the end of each network epoch. Each node will be monitored by its peer nodes. When an Elastic Sidechain has reached the end of its lifetime, the resources (computation and storage) of its virtual sub-nodes will be freed so that validator nodes may participate in newly created Elastic Sidechains.

To be added as a node to the SKALE Network, a prospective node must run the SKALE Admin, which manages all operations in the node and is installed with the skale-node-cli. SKALE Admin evaluates the prospective node to ensure that it is upholding network hardware requirements. If the prospective node passes this verification step, the SKALE Admin permits the node to submit a request to SKALE Manager in order to join the network. This request contains both the required network deposit as well as node metadata collected by the SKALE Daemon (e.g., IP address, port, public key, etc.).

Once the request has been submitted to SKALE Manager on Ethereum, SKALE Manager randomly defines the prospective node as either a ""full node"" or a ""fractional node"" by assigning different sizes of SKALE Chains to the prospective node. Full nodes have all of their resources utilized for a single Elastic Sidechain, while fractional nodes participate in multiple Elastic Sidechains (multi-tenancy).

After the node registration, the node receives an assigned group of random node peers to monitor. Peers regularly audit several metrics at predetermined periods (e.g. five minutes) and submit the batched metrics to the SKALE Manager once for every network epoch. The batched metrics are used to determine the node's bounty reward. Currently, each node will only monitor downtime and latency for the other node peers, and more metrics will be added upon further testing.

Users receive limited governance rights over Serum in proportion to their holdings. Serum also uses 80% of the revenue generated by the exchange to buy back and burn SRM tokens every week. The remaining 20% gets distributed to SRM stakers that have locked their holding in Serum's staking contract.

There are two types of Serum tokens: SRM and MegaSerum (MSRM). Both tokens give holders governance rights over Serum and reduced trading fees on Serum. They also enable activate participants to receive staking rewards (cut of protocol revenue) and benefit from Sereum's buy-and-burn mechanism. MSRM can be created when users lock up 1,000,000 SRM together. The supply of MSRM is capped at 1,000 MSRM (or 10% of total SRM). Each MSRM receives slightly more rewards than 1 million SRM and is required to run a validator node. Locked SRM and MSRM still gets fee discounts and can participate in governance.","Initial Exchange Offering, Private Sale","Project Serum hosted two simultaneous initial exchange offerings (IEOs) for the SRM token on Aug. 7, 2020. The two exchanges (FTX and BitMax) exchange sold 3 million SRM at a price of roughly $0.11/token (or $660,000 in total). KYC was required for both IEOs, and a cap of 1,800 participants was set between both exchanges.

Prior to the IEOs, pre-sales were held for 400 MegaSerum (equivalent to 400 million SRM, or ~4% of the total supply), raising a total of roughly ~$20m. all pre-sales are locked up over the next 1-7 years from the time of the sale.

A node may propose a rules change for 50,000 SRM, which is deducted from the proposer's overall asset pool. If the rules change passes, the 50,000 SRM is returned. otherwise, the initial deposit gets burned.

__Voting__
A node may be designated as a ‘voting-stake’ node or a ‘delegated-stake’ node. In a voting-stake node, each staker votes independently, and the majority vote of the node determines its behavior. In a delegated-stake node, each node’s leader chooses how they vote. Whenever submissions are requested from a node, any staker may propose a response to the node. A delegated-stake node’s leader chooses which response to submit, and a voting-stake node has a vote among their stakers to decide what to submit.

Proposals require more than 60% of the world’s total staked SRM voting in favor to pass (this parameter may be further changed via a proposal, within bounds).",,,

Zclassic is a fork of Zcash, which is itself a fork of Bitcoin. Like most bitcoin-related forks, Horizen has a 21 million cap and was initially distributed with an airdrop of 1:1 Horizen: ZEN to anyone before block 100,000. 

A primary claim in the Horizen block rewards model is that bitcoin’s consensus does not incentivize other stakeholders, such as full node operators. Originally, Horizen's block rewards yielded 3.5% to the full node operators, given that they meet certain requirements. Horizen changed their model in July of 2018 by introducing a new node class and shifting the block rewards distribution to give both secure and super node operators 10% of the total block rewards. Miners who were originally rewarded 88% of each block reward received 70%, while the remaining 10% went to the Treasury, a 1.5% increase from the original model.

Due to lack of enough funding for ongoing development as a result of 2018 bear market, the team proposed to increase the Treasury pool to 20% of block rewards while reducing the mining reward pool from 70% to 60% which has been implemented as a result of a successfully hard fork at the block height #455555.

Therefore, the current block rewards split between each of the four groups is: 

Secure nodes – 10%
Super nodes – 10%
Miners – 60%
Treasury – 20%

The founders and directors of the Zen Blockchain Foundation are responsible for managing the funds of the Horizen Treasury, until at such point that the community is able to govern the treasury. The Horizen treasury model is designed to eventually become a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and claims that it will be provably fair, transparent, and provide economic incentives for participation. 

",Inflationary,Decreasing Issuance,True,21000000.0,"Horizen uses an ammended version of Nakamoto Consensus whereby the valid chain is the longest chain with the most accumulated proof-of-work. Consensus in Horizen, and other systems using Nakamoto Conensus, is probabilistic because there is always a chance that a new, longer competing chain could emerge with more accumulated proof-of-work that would invalidate the current chain. 

Horizen's consensus algorithm attempts to enhance original Nakamoto Consensus by incorporating a penalty system for delayed block submission to make it much costlier to execute a successful 51% attack.

ZBF contracts Horizen Labs for development work and consulting. Horizen Labs is a for-profit company mainly focusing on ZK circuit construction and business support for Horizen's sidechain implementation - Zendoo.   Protocol development is governed by the Horizen Improvement Proposal process (ZenIP) whereby anyone in the open-source Horizen community can submit draft ZenIPs. After discussion by the Horizen community and the ZenIP editors, features are selected for the upcoming network upgrade. There are three organizations, Horizen Community Council, Zen Blockchain Foundation, and Horizen Labs Company each have one editor elected for the process. ZenIP Editors have to make decisions and unanimity cannot be assumed and is not necessary for all kinds of decisions. Majority decision means more than half (  50%) of the Editors need to agree. Supermajority decision means more than two thirds (  66.6%) need to agree. Additionally, there are decisions that require unanimity. Decisions from the ZenIP process are written into the Horizen specification, as well as the software that runs the network. Protocol changes are ""ratified"" on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus.  

The Zen Blockchain Foundation receives an allocation of the treasury reward for every block, which consists of 20% of the block reward. Moving forward, Zen Blockchain Foundation plans to further decentralize the Horizen project through building a treasury sidechain governance system, increasing community involvement, and ultimately reducing the influence of itself on the Horizen protocol.

Sia documentation indicates it has two tokens: (1) Siacoin (SC), which is the network utility token that trades on crypto exchanges, and (2) Siafunds, which is a tokenized revenue-sharing security that is privately held by qualified investors. Siafunds are not listed for trading on exchanges, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has classified Siafunds as securities. 

The utility of Siacoin is cloud data storage. The technology connects users who need file storage with hosts who have unused hard-drive space to offer. Siafunds pay out a transaction fee in real time from all storage payments on the Sia network. Siafunds generate fees only when users pay for file storage to align incentives with Siacoin holders. 

The Sia blockchain enables this marketplace to operate without an intermediary through smart contracts. Both renters and hosts use Siacoin, the native cryptocurrency token of the Sia blockchain. Renters use Siacoin to buy unused storage capacity from hosts, while hosts deposit Siacoin into each file contract as collateral. No one person or organization can censor the data on the network. 

Sia has two wallets available to download: Sia UI and SIA Daemon. Sia UI is more user-friendly while Daemon is for someone who is comfortable with command-line instructions.",Private Sale,"Siacoin was launched as a utility token in a manner similar to Bitcoin mining. Siacoin is a proof-of-work token, which is mined by a distributed computing network using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Application Specific Devices (ASICs). The Sia core team states that it chose to own less than 1% of the total Siacoin supply to promote decentralized distribution of the native token.

Sia also features a Proof-of-Burn mechanism. Every time a host does not present a valid storage proof, the part of the host's Sia collateral used to back the renter's files as well as the profit that would have been paid by the renter are burned and permanently removed from the supply.

ONT holders do not receive any form returns solely by holding ONT but can be rewarded for their respective contributions towards the management and operation of the Ontology blockchain or participate in the network's <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-stake"">Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</a> consensus model. The team anticipates ONT could eventually contribute to the management of the Ontology blockchain. These contributions include commitments of ONT into the system reserved pool, which helps secure the network (i.e., a particular stake of ONT would be required to be placed for the running of nodes, facilitating consensus execution, transaction verification, etc.). 

ONG (Ontology Gas) is Ontology’s second utility token. The operation of Ontology requires support from various types of nodes to provide network security and stability. Network nodes receive ONG payments for any operational costs to incentivize operator participation. These payments originate from Ontology users, who pay ONG to Ontology network nodes to request Ontology services. The services that network nodes provide include transactions, network storage, deployment and execution of smart contracts, and use of other resources in Ontology. ONT holders requesting Ontology network nodes periodically pay ONG in operation costs to maintain the ongoing operation of the network.

Unlike most other cryptoassets, ONT is indivisible; users can only acquire ONT tokens in whole units. Its counterpart, ONG, is divisible up to nine decimal points 

Ontology tried to create a positive feedback loop by utilizing a dual-token design. This design uses ONT for staking and ONG as gas. Within the staking design, network nodes deposit ONT on the network to act as a financial burden incentivizing unselfish behavior. These same stakers receive ONG as revenue for deploying their resources and enduring operating costs to help secure the network. Ontology's system also uses ONG in a utility token role as it acts as a value anchoring tool for on-chain applications.

The tokens are still available to be claimed by select recipients until the 4th of May 2022 after which unclaimed tokens would be sent to the DAO treasury. The token distribution is broken down as follows:

Airdrop to .ETH Holders

25% of the 100 million token supply has been earmarked as an airdrop to ETH addresses that are registrants of a .ETH second-level domain. Over 137,000 wallets were eligible to receive this airdrop. Addresses received tokens in proportion to the total time of their past registration and future registration as at the airdrop snapshot (October 31, 2021). Active users of domain service, identified by the status of their Primary ENS Name, received a 2x multiplier as the platform determined this group of users contributed more to the growth of the service.

Contributors

This group of recipients are allocated 25% of the total supply. Core contributors (11 people) were apportioned a large chunk of the allocation with about 19% of the total supply. Other contributors include launch advisors (0.58%), future contributors (1.25%), external contributors (1.29%), translators (0.05%), select integrations (2.50%), keyholders (0.25%), and active discord users (0.125%).

Community Treasury

The rest of the supply (50%) is allocated to the DAO treasury.

Prior to setting up the DAO in November 2021, operations were community-driven but the core team were in charge of managing some decisions like the control of existing and future cash flows. Now, a delegated decentralized governance mechanism has been put in place through the DAO to handle all decision-making.

For off-chain voting, ENS makes use of Snapshot, a voting interface that captures community members' sentiments on ideas off-chain. Voting on snapshot is proportional to the amount of ENS tokens delegated to the voting address. Governance-related discussions are carried out in a dedicated discourse forum. Community members are encouraged to join any of the four workstream groups: Meta-Governance, Community, ENS Ecosystem, and Public Goods.

The ENS DAO also has an off-chain representation in an entity called the ENS Foundation. This Foundation, set up in the Cayman Islands, helps the DAO comply with tax requirements, enter contracts and partnerships with other legal entities, and also provides limited liability to DAO participants for actions the DAO takes.

The Foundation was set up as a non-profit organization with no shareholders. Initially set up with three directors, the Foundation now has two directors who are charged with running the daily operations of the entity. These directors, Nick Johnson and Kevin Gaspar, are also core members of the ENS team. Finally, DS Limited, a Cayman Islands firm, has a supervisory role to ensure the directors act in accordance with Cayman Islands laws.

It is important to note that the ENS DAO has significant power over the Foundation as specified in the Foundation's Articles of Incorporation. The DAO has the power to appoint/remove a director, member or supervisor. It can also instruct the directors on specific actions to take such as engaging another legal entity on behalf of the DAO, signing contracts, and even winding up the foundation.",Delegated On-Chain Vote,"On-chain voting and other relevant on-chain governance acts are carried out on the Tally governance portal. With the portal, token holders can delegate their votes, and delegates can create and/or vote on proposals. There are three classes of proposals that can pass through the on-chain governance process: Executable Proposals, Social Proposals, and Constitutional Amendment.

__Executable Proposals__

These are proposals relating to smart contract operations to be executed by accounts controlled by the DAO. Proposals of this nature require a quorum of 1% and a minimum vote approval of 50% to pass.

__Social Proposals__

These proposals are for decisions that cannot be enforced on-chain. An example of such is a proposal to increase the royalty fee for the ENS secondary market on OpenSea. These proposals have a 1% quorum requirement and 50% voter approval to pass.

__Constitutional Amendment__

As the name implies, it is a proposal petitioning the DAO to amend certain parts of the constitution. This has a quorum requirement of 1% and minimum approval of two-thirds to pass.",True,,

When an idea is well supported with positive feedback in discord conversations, it is time to write the idea up in a “proposal” and invite the community to vote on it.  The first phase is off-chain voting which occurs on Snapshot. 

Off-chain voting consists of two sub-phases: 
Temperature Check –  a Temperature Check is a simple yes/no poll that is used to determine if there is enough initial community interest. At the end of the Temperature Check period, If a majority votes ‘Yes’, the proposal moves to the next phase. Otherwise, the proposal is abandoned at this phase and does not proceed.  
Consensus Check– a Consensus Check is a yes/no or multiple-choice poll that is used to establish formal voting around a proposal that passes the first Temperature Check, and helps refine proposals and lead to a concrete solution  If a majority votes ‘Yes’, the proposal moves to the next phase. Otherwise, the proposal is abandoned at this phase and does not proceed.
For proposals that do not require a technical improvements or alterations to blockchain’s smart contracts (for example product improvements), the proposal will not go through on-chain voting, and instead, the proposal will be executed/completed by the team. Other proposals move to the on-chain voting phase before execution. ",Direct On-Chain Vote,"__Technical Proposals__
For proposals that require technical implementations or changes to the blockchain’s smart contracts, the proposal will require going through the on-chain voting phase. 

The purpose of the on-chain voting is to establish formal voting around a proposal that passed Phase 2.2: Consensus Check. This is the last step in the governance process before moving to the execution phase. 

The final phase of governance is the Execution Period, also called the Enactment Period or Time Lock. At the end of the on-chain voting period of the previous step, the on-chain proposal enters a time lock period of 7 days during which it must be executed. If the results of the on-chain proposal do not suggest a change from the status quo, the topic will be closed. If the results of the on-chain proposal suggest a change, the change suggested in the proposal can be executed on-chain during the 7 day period. 

Any user can send a transaction to the smart contract to execute the accepted proposal. This does require some technical knowledge, but can be done from a UI like Etherscan.",,,

More specifically, the IMX token draws fees, can be staked, and offers decentralized governance.   

Below are descriptions of each utility:  
-20% of network fees must be paid in IMX. Users do not need to hold IMX to facilitate these transactions, as the network can automatically swap the actual purchase currency (e.g. participants can pay 100% in ETH, and Immutable will convert the mandatory 20% into IMX).  
-All fee-produced IMX tokens are sent to a staking rewards pool. This pool proportionally distributes tokens on a daily basis to those actively staking IMX tokens. For IMX tokens to be considered staked, they must be held on L1 or L2 and the member must have voted on a governance proposal within the past 30 days. Additionally, members  must have completed a trade within the preceding 30 days or be holding an NFT on the network.   * 

Note: Rewards are distributed on L2, dictating that members must have an L2 wallet linked to their L1 wallet to receive reward tokens.* 

-Member voting accounts for a significant portion of the token’s utility. To vote on proposals, the member must be holding a certain number of tokens. This threshold, like other governance protocols, is subject to change pending the voting community.

It allows participants to pay for animation and be paid for making their computing power available to other participants. A person with excess of GPU power can register his/her workstation on the RNDR network and earn tokens for completing render jobs. The network takes care of the job and resources allocation for the completion of the job, and the tokens earned by the node operators involved during the process can be used to pay for future render jobs in the network.   

Users with no experience in crypto can leverage the use of RNDR credits, that can be purchased using PayPal and Stripe, directly through the RNDR Portal. These credits are all backed by real tokens, meaning every time a user acquires credits the same amount of tokens are acquired by the RNDR team from an exchange. This helps ease the entrance of new players in the system, while endure the node operators will be paid always in the same native token.  

For users not using RNDR credits, a wallet needs to be created. It needs to be an ERC-20 compatible wallet, being MetaMask the preferred wallet of the RNDR team. It should not be a a wallet from an exchange. This wallet is then linked to the user profile and made available for make and receive payments.  

The RNDR network has two smart contracts. In February 2019 it was announced updates in the token to include additional escrow smart-contract functionality, and the token migration process started.

10% - Team Members and Advisors, with a Lockup of six months 
25% - Token Sale Purchasers 
65% - User Development Fund, to be flowed back to the network as demand increases  

From January 2018 to May 2018 a Private Sale was done. The token price at the private sale was the same as the ICO (1 $RNDR = $0.25 USD).

Community governance enables the community of $RLY holders to direct all major changes to Rally Network. Holders of $RLY take part in Rally Governance through voting, including accepting new Rally creators (who can create proposals), $RLY grants, and Rally tech/network upgrades.

Rally Governance takes place in these key areas:
Rally Discord: Where the community at large gathers to discuss all things Rally
Rally Forum: Where users go to discuss discrete proposals. Make sure to create an account to participate in discussions.
Rally Snapshot: Where users go to vote on current proposals, or review previous proposals. 

Rally’s goal is to be a decentralized network for creators to monetize and align themselves with their community. As a community-owned network, the community is in charge of making the decisions for how the network evolves, not the Rally team itself.",Direct On-Chain Vote,"Beginning at mainnet launch on Oct 15, the Rally team selected nine trusted individuals or organizations from the existing Rally community, which currently consists of the Rally team, advisors, and creators, to form a *Rally Genesis Team*. The purpose of this team was to provide a safe start to community governance.

__*Rally Genesis Team*__ — Holds the multi-sig keys that authorize spend from the Community Treasury and administer $RLY grants to the community (⅔ quorum). Can propose creators into the Rally Registry and create proposals.

__*Rally Registry*__ — Whitelist of creators and developers that can create new proposals and issue their own Creator Coin.

__*Future Multi-Sig Holders*__ — The Rally Genesis Team plans to turn over all multi-sig operations to various reputable community members that emerge in the Rally Network over time.
# __Proposal Types__
Rally Registry members must hold a minimum balance of 1,000 $RLY to create proposals. New proposals can be created by members of the Rally Registry on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/rallygov.eth). There are currently several types of proposals available with format templates to be published (and modified) in Discourse:
1. *Add Rally Registry members*
2. *Remove Rally Registry members*
3. *Define Community Treasury award tiers*
4. *Propose $RLY grants from community pools*
5. *Direct Tech/Network upgrades*

__1. Add Rally Registry Members (Initial quorum: 0%, requirement to pass: 51%)__
Must adhere to the standard proposal format published in Discourse. If the vote fails, the proposed Rally Registry member cannot be put up for nomination for another 10 days.


__2. Remove Rally Registry Members (Initial quorum: 10%, requirement to pass: 66%)__
Proposals can be made to freeze a Creator Coin or outright remove a Registry Member and their Creator Coin. The Rally team will work with the community to administer the available enforcement methods.


__3. Community Treasury Awards (Initial quorum: 3%, requirement to pass: 51%)__
Approved creators may receive a reserve of their Creator Coins purchased by the Community Treasury to be used as they see fit (this also establishes initial collateral). Rally Registry members can choose to modify these award tiers. Initial award tiers are as follows:
- T1- $0
- T2- $250
- T3- $500
- T4- $1,000
- T5- $2,000
- T6- $3,000
__4. Propose $RLY grants from community pools (Initial quorum: 3%, requirement to pass: 66%)__

__5. Tech/Network Upgrades (Initial quorum: 3%, requirement to pass: 51%)__
After mainnet launch, all major network upgrades must be approved by the community. The Rally team will serve as the administrator to the community and push releases based on managerial direction from the community. For example, network upgrades in the near-term might include administering and defining parameters for Network Usage Rewards and TBC designs.

__New Types of Proposals (Initial quorum 50%, requirement to pass: 51%)__
New types of proposals can be included over time but require a significant quorum to pass.
# __Roadmap to Community-Run Governance__
This “phase one” Rally Governance framework places the majority of network control in the hands of the community. As usage of social tokens on the sidechain grows, so too does the amount of $RLY being staked. Those users participating in Rally Governance will define parameters such as network fees, network usage rewards, and TBC designs",,,

In 2017, a total of 500 million STORJ tokens were introduced and the legacy token SJCX was discontinued, alongside a migration from the Bitcoin onto the Ethereum blockchain. A total of 72 million STORJ was distributed to the public through the pre and main sale, raising $30 million for the project. A further 20.66 million SJCX remained outstanding and were eligible for conversion into STORJ and a 1:1 rate up until Dec. 2017. The 450 million SJCX tokens held by Storj were converted into 450 million STORJ tokens during this time. 

A total of 125 million STORJ tokens have been publicly distributed to date. This includes 2.99 million STORJ tokens paid out to service providers, 72 million STORJ sold to the public, and 50 million legacy SJCX tokens, which includes legacy SJCX reserved for conversion. 

Following these distributions Storj retained 375 million, of which 75 million have been burned, leaving the project with 300 million tokens. Of these, 245 million remain locked until June 20, 2018, having initially been scheduled to be released on Dec. 20, 2017. The remaining 55 million tokens are unlocked and available for use by Storj to pay service providers, including farmers. 

As a result of the burning of 75 million tokens, the total token supply stands at 425 million. 

There remains a lack of clarity regarding the release of the remaining tokens held by Storj, following the decision to extend the lock-up period until June 2018. The project has indicated that they have enough funds to operate until this date, at which time they can better evaluate the project’s timeline.

The first token, rETH, represents staked and yield-bearing ETH. ETH is swapped for rETH when users stake towards a node operator in the Rocket Pool network. Users' rETH can be deployed into DeFi protocols or sold as desired. The other token native to the protocol is RPL, which is bonded only by node operators wishing to provide additional security guarantees on top of their validation services. Users with ERC-20 wallets can buy both RPL and rETH. Those with RPL and 16 ETH can freely provide node operator services. RPL can be purchased on Uniswap, Balancer, Bancor, and other exchanges. 

In addition to depositing ETH, a node operator is incentivized to deposit some RPL per ether they are depositing. This represents additional skin in the game and those node operators with RPL bonds should accrue increased share of user staking. The minimum collateral required is currently 10% of the ETH value and capped at a maximum of 150%. Further, those nodes who do bond RPL will receive additional commissions on top of those denominated in ETH. If they fail to perform their network duties and through penalties or slashing conditions end up with < 32 ETH from their original 32 ETH deposit, their RPL security deposit is burned proportional to their ETH losses for failing to provide the promised additional security for their node. As per supply & demand conditions, node operators will receive a variable commission in both ETH and RPL.

A Rocket Pool DAO will be formed in the future to allow RPL stakers the ability to affect decisions on smart contract upgrades and minor changes in settings across the network.

A third token, nETH is a 1:1ETH representation of the deposit, rewards, and commission of node operators. During Phase 0 and 1 of the Ethereum 2.0 roll-out, withdrawals from the beacon chain are not live. nETH acts as a mechanism to provide noder operators with liquidity prior to Phase 2 of the roll-out. When Phase 2 goes, live noder operators will be able to swap nETH for beacon chain ETH, effectively burning the nETH from circulation.","Crowdsale, Private Sale","The Rocket Pool team holds 15% of the supply.

These oracle nodes will inform Ethereum 1.0 about whether node operators are perfomring duties properly, for example. To support consensus, oracle nodes have two categories of duties: oracle tasks and service tasks. The former include verifying minipool (validator) ETH balances (minimum of 16 ETH), tracking and relaying validator performance, and ensuring the minimum bonded threshold of 10% RPL is met by validators (verifying the RPL:ETH ratio). The latter category of oracle node duties includes tracking when node operators exit the staking pool and ensuring that all slack ETH in the protocol is in fact being staked. The oracle nodes will collectively form a DAO. Members are required to stake a large amount of RPL to signal their alignment. This bond provides the potential for large economic loss if they act maliciously. Effectie members of the Oracle DAO will be compensated in RPL issuance. 

Node operators are responsible for attesting to Ethereum transactions and validating blocks. Node operators are required to show up with 16 ETH and are matched with 16 ETH from non-technical stakers who are using Rocket Pool.

n the future, RPL governance will be the driving force that is able to propose changes to these settings and pass them, should the majority wish it. The Protocol DAO will also need to ensure development of the protocol can continue to happen in a decentralized manner.

Governance will take the form of the Rocket Pool DAO, where voting weight corresponds to amount of RPL staked in the protocol. This  staked RPL will come from two sources, passive stakers (non node operators) and node operators. A suggestion within the governance forum is to ensure that active stakers (node operators) have more representation in voting than passive stakers. To achieve this, the protocol would cap the ratio of passively staked RPL to actively staked RPL. For example, a 90% ratio cap would ensure that node operators have a slightly more say in the direction of the protocol.",,,

The native token of the Nervos CKB is the ""Common Knowledge Byte,"" or CKByte for short. CKBytes entitle a token holder to occupy part of the total state storage of the blockchain. For example, by holding 1000 CKBytes, a user is able to create a cell of 1000 bytes in capacity or multiple cells adding up to 1000 bytes in capacity.

In Nervos, the network's state is stored in a set of so-called ""cells."" The change of state (like a transaction or smart contract call), as in the “update” of cell content, is done through cell destruction and cell creation, which means the content of the original cell is not directly changed. Every transaction actually destroys some cells and creates new ones. The newly-created cells will have new owners and store new data.

This cell system mimics Bitcoin's UTXO model. When a cell is destroyed, it is marked as “destroyed” in the same way a UTXO is marked as “spent”, instead of being removed from the blockchain. Every cell can only be destroyed once, just as every UTXO can only be spent once. After a user releases state storage, they will receive an amount of CKBytes equivalent to the size of state (in bytes) their data was occupying.

NervosDAO
Nervos CKB includes a special smart contract called the NervosDAO. Users that deposit their holdings into the DAO receive a portion of the network's secondary issuance (the base issuance being the block rewards for PoW miners). Using CKBs to store data on the CKB creates an opportunity cost to CKByte owners; they will not be able to deposit occupied CKBs into the NervosDAO to receive a portion of the secondary issuance. 

The economic model of the CKB is an attempt in using an economic incentive to bound state growth. While CKBs are being used to store state, they cannot be used to earn secondary issuance rewards through the NervosDAO. This makes the secondary issuance a function like a ""state rent"" on state storage occupation. This economic model imposes state storage fees proportional to both the space and time of occupation, which is far different from the ""pay once, occupy forever"" models used by chains like Ethereum.

Miner Rewards
Miners are compensated with both block rewards and transaction fees. For block rewards, when a miner mines a block, they would receive the block's full base issuance reward and a portion of secondary issuance. The portion is based on state occupation. Therefore, if half of all native tokens are being used to store state, a miner would receive half of the secondary issuance reward for the block. When Nervos' mining rewards eventually end, miners will still receive ""state rent"" income that's independent of transactions.","Crowdsale, Private Sale","The genesis block of the Nervos Network contained 33.6 billion CKB, of which 8.4 billion were burned.

The tokens were sold in a Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool, which allows for a more fair way of raising funds by creating a downward pressure on the price over the duration of the sale.

Prior to the public sale, 5 million tokens were distributed privately to pre-seed and seed investors, the team, and treasury. The Balancer sale on March 30th 2021 was the start of the lock-up for these tokens. The tokens will vest linearly over 12 months starting one year after the public sale, i.e. March 30th 2022.

The remaining tokens will be distributed through yield farming and in-game rewards over time. The total supply is thus as follows:
Public investors: 1.0 million ILV (10%)
Pre-seed investors: 0.5 million ILV (5%)
Seed investors: 1.5 million ILV (15%)
Team: 1.5 million ILV (15%)
Treasury: 1.5 million ILV (15%)
Yield farming: 3.0 million ILV (30%)
In-game rewards: 1.0 million ILV (10%)

Farming Yield

Launched on June 30th 2021, yield farming is set to take three years and 3 million tokens are reserved for the program.

There are two core pools, the ILV pool and the ILV/ETH pool, as well as partner pools which can be staked in order to receive additional ILV tokens. The pools differ in what tokens are staked, the pool weight and the risks. Pools with higher weights will receive more tokens from liquidity mining.

In the core pools, stakers can optionally lock their tokens for a period of up to 12 months. This changes the token weight. By increasing the duration, the token weight will increase with a maximum of 2. The higher the pool weight, the token weight, and the number of tokens staked, the higher the token distributions will be.

Tokens accumulated in yield farming will only be distributed after being vested. When tokens are vested, they are locked in the ILV pool for 12 months and count to the accumulation of new tokens at a token weight of 2. This means that the yield farming rewards will start being minted 12 months after the launch of staking at the earliest, i.e. June 30th 2022. Instead of vesting, stakers also have the option to claim their tokens in the form of sILV. This burns an equivalent amount of ILV. Unlike ILV, there is no vesting period on sILV and they can be used immediately in-game.

In-game Yield

Besides liquidity mining, 1 million tokens are reserved for in-game rewards. The tokens will be distributed through in-game tournament battles, quests, and daily challenges. This incentivizes gameplay and allows players lacking in capital to gain access to yield rewards.

Revenue Distributions

Finally, stakers also earn yield from revenue distributions. The game will generate revenue from in-game purchases and exchange fees, and players use ETH for these transactions. All the revenue is distributed as rewards to stakers through an ILV buyback system. As the ILV tokens are being bought back with ETH and then redistributed, the token supply is not impacted by revenue distributions. The distributions also do not have to be vested.

Inflation

As the yield rewards depend on the various staking factors and the amount of ILV claimed over sILV, the exact inflation is unpredictable. Within 3 years, up to 3 million ILV will be distributed as yield rewards. Inflation resulting from in-game rewards is also difficult to predict as it depends on in-game activity. Over time, 1 million ILV will be distributed as in-game rewards. Yield and in-game rewards are left out from the supply curve because of the unpredictability.",Inflationary,Decreasing Inflation Rate,True,10000000.0,,,,,,,,,,"The community of ILV holders will govern and maintain the protocol by proposing changes to the protocol.

ICCPs are put forth to modify System Configuration Variables, which include council values, marketplace fees, capture mechanics, and balance changes. IIPs are used to make improvements to the protocol, such as new contracts, new systems, expansions, and character sets.

Proposals are submitted to the Github repository and will be posted on the Illuvium Proposal space. There, they are voted on by the Illuvinati Council and recorded on-chain.

Upon passage, the vote is recorded on-chain and the proposal is implemented by the core developer team. Quadratic voting is utilized to reduce the voting power of large ILV holders.

Despite the council reaching a consensus, an ExecutionerDAO is set up to act as a backstop for the protocol in case of emergency.",True,,

Work across the network is distributed to KEEP stakers, in proportion to their staked amount, by a random beacon. Misbehaving stakers have their KEEP slashed and are removed from the network, similar to other proof of stake mechanisms.

According to the Keep team, the random beacon (the core of the system used for work selection) cannot function without a network-specific token that grows and shrinks with the utilization of the network. Using a network-specific token makes attacks from outsiders with large pools of capital much more expensive.

Staked KEEP holders earn revenue from operating the beacon and participating in work across the network, in the form of keeps. Keeps are multi-party computation setups that offer services to other smart contracts, including decentralized signing, encryption, and data storage.

Any dApps built on top of the Keep Network, such as tBTC, require operational keeps in order to function and thus staked KEEP. No other existing digital asset can serve as a replacement to the KEEP Token in the tBTC ecosystem.","Airdrop, Private Sale","Token Allocation Overview

Private Sale Details
Keep conducted an industrial staker sale that occurred in two tranches. The Series A tranche occurred in 2018, and the Series B tranche occurred in Fall 2019/Winter 2020. All purchasers were accredited investors, sold via a 506(b) offering. To date, Keep has sold approximately $20 million  worth of KEEP tokens. One covenant of the SAFT agreements that was included was the requirement that purchasers support the network by staking their KEEP tokens.

Public Distribution Plans (Stakedrop)
The plan is for up to 20% of KEEP to be distributed in a public stakedrop starting June 8th, 2020. The goal is to decentralize and strengthen the network by incentivizing Ethereum community members to stake ETH for the tBTC system in order to earn KEEP rewards and continue their Keep network participation. Another 5% will be rewarded to tBTC liquidity providers on-chain, helping incentivize the growth of the tBTC ecosystem.","[{'title': 'Industrial Staker Sale (Series A Tranche)', 'start_date': '2017-10-01T04:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private (accredited investors only)', 'details': 'Investors could receive a bonus ranging from 20%-50%, depending on lockup periods they selected (six months to two years).', 'end_date': '2018-06-01T04:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': 'USD', 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.072, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 12148809.3, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Staker Sale (Series B Tranche)', 'start_date': '2019-04-01T04:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private (accredited investors only)', 'details': 'Investors could receive a 20% bonus if they chose a one year lockup period', 'end_date': '2020-02-01T05:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': 'USD', 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.12, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 6704329.36, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}]",[],[],,[],1000000000.0,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': 35, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': 40, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': 25}",2020-04-27T04:00:00Z,,"Private staker sale
The Keep team sold a total of 322,882,336 KEEP in its two private staker sales. Purchasers received the option to collect bonus tokens, ranging from 20%-50% more tokens depending on the lockup period selected (six months to two years). The longer the lock, the greater the bonus. The second sale came with a one-year lockup in addition to a 20% bonus. Among the total distributed through these sales:
50,638,076 KEEP will unlock after six months
47,168,287 KEEP will unlock one year after distribution
225,075,973 KEEP will unlock two years after distribution

Team, associates, and Keep SEZC allocations
Keep allocated 390,598,594 KEEP to early team members and advisors, associates and vendors, and Keep SEZC (the Keep project corporate entity).
Vendors and Associates received 851,917 KEEP, which will vest anywhere from six months to two years (most at the two-year mark)
Early Team & Advisors received 139,746,677, which will vest after two years and come with a four-year restriction on use
Keep SEZC received 250,000,000 with no associated vesting or lockup schedule

Public distribution
Keep plans to distributed up to 20% of the KEEP supply (200 million KEEP) during its public stakedrop event, which launched on Jun. 8, 2020. A stakedrop allows users with ETH, but no KEEP, to stake their ETH in exchange for KEEP token rewards (alongside signer fees). After 6 months, participants will also need to stake KEEP to continue earning rewards. This event could last for up to 24 months with most of the rewards handed out during the first six months.

Another 5% of the KEEP supply (50 million KEEP) will be rewarded to tBTC liquidity providers on-chain to help incentivize the growth of the tBTC ecosystem. Keep has not released details on when it will start issuing these liquidity rewards

The exact timing of public KEEP distribution will be variable. Therefore, the Liquid Supply Curve here is based on the rewards model created by Bison Trails.

Slashing events
All of the KEEP supply was minted when the Keep team deployed the token contract to the Etherereum mainnet. Therefore, KEEPs do not have an inflation model that results from the creation of new tokens (as with Bitcoin or Ethereum via block rewards). But the max supply of KEEPs can decrease over time through slashing. A slashing event occurs when a network signer acts against the rules of the network and, in return, has a portion of their staked KEEP burned permanently. These slashing events are unpredictable and thus not modeled into the Liquid Supply Curve.",Fixed Supply,Fixed Supply,True,1000000000.0,,n/a,,,,,,,,"Keep follows an ""opt-in"" governance model, requiring consent from stakers and users before any new code is run. The network is built around the keep registry, a registry of contracts stakers and users can choose to trust.

Stakers authorize new contracts in the registry, opting to follow the rules of the contract, and earn rewards for operating by those rules. Users authorize contracts via direct interaction, or by using a dApp based off one of the contracts.

The registry owner account can propose new code by publishing to the registry. Today, the proposer account is held by Keep SEZC (the corporation behind the Keep Network), though the team expects it to be replaced with a more formal process as the project further decentralizes.

The tBTC system, built atop Keep, has no mechanism for code improvements on mainnet. Governance of the contracts is limited to an emergency lever to pause operations for a fixed period of time in case of an exploit, as well as fee parameters. All are governed by the contract owner, currently Keep SEZC, rather than token holders. Any meaningful changes to tBTC will require a social upgrade, akin to a hard fork.",No On-Chain Governance,,,,

Different lending pools have different levels of SPELL emissions, a total of 665,448,024 SPELLs are currently minted per week as of the time of writing.  

Also, owners of SPELL can stake their SPELL token to obtain sSPELL. With sSPELL, it represents users' share of the SPELL fee pool, when user unstake their sSPELL tokens, they will receive their original SPELL token plus any additional SPELL earned from the fees. sSPELL owners can also take part in governance.",,"The original tokens were distributed via an IDO, the total IDO supply was distributed half on Uniswap v3 and half on Sushiswap.

The token serves utility and governance purposes. Being available in both standards means that users can switch TWT between the Binance Chain and the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It has two main uses:
Utility: TWT holders are entitled to a variety of benefits, such as discounts on in-app purchases and DEX services.
Governance: The token allows holders to participate in decision-making processes, including adding new tokens, features,and blockchain support (see Governance section).

Trust Wallet’s founder, Viktor Radchenko, originally designed the project’s native token as an experimental version of a referral rewards program.

In August 2020, Radchenko submitted a Token Issuance Proposal to the Binance Chain community, regarding the Trust Wallet Token project. The stated goal was to further evolve Web 3 technologies and provide easier access to decentralized financial services, while increasing the adoption of crypto currency. The proposal was accepted and the Trust Wallet Token became one of the first tokens to launch on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) – Binance’s newly launched project, which works in parallel with the Binance Chain and facilitates the creation of smart contracts along with the staking mechanism for BNB.

The token acts as an educational tool as well as a community-builder. The founder believed that one of the best ways to learn about digital assets was to own one, so he decided to create a token that would only have value within the Trust wallet ecosystem. A loyal community following has grown around the token and holders are attracted to community forums where they are given detailed instructions on how to perform swaps, trades, or exchanges and how to create value with TWT.

Giveaways frequently feature tokens from newly integrated protocols and provide TWT holders an opportunity to adopt other digital assets. For example, 30,000 eGold tokens were airdropped to TWT to announce the integration of the Elrond protocol.",Fair Launch with Built-in Treasury,"At Genesis on February 29, 2020, 90 billion tokens were minted and despite continuous token distribution, less than 1% of the total supply was circulating.

Therefore, Trust Wallet team made the decision to burn 89 billion TWT to reduce the total supply to 1 billion TWT. More than 250 million tokens were distributed as rewards to early users by August 2020.  This means that around 25% of the total supply is now distributed.",[],,[],,[],90000000000.0,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': None, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': None, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': None}",,2020-02-29T00:00:00Z,"In October 2020, the Trust Wallet team readdressed their tokenomics prior to switching to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The decision was made to burn 89 billion TWT to bring the current minted amount to 1 billion TWT. The existing BEP-2 tokenholders were offered the option to bridge their existing TWT to the BSC.

As at May 2021, just under 350 million tokens had been circulated as rewards. The current soft cap is set at the currently minted 1 billion TWT.

There is currently no official roadmap for the spending of the remaining 650 million tokens. Allocated but unspent tokens are as follows:
Community Rewards for Existing Users: 46,7%
Reserve Wallet: 30%
New User Acquisition: 8.3%
Developers: 15%",,Fixed Supply,,,,,,,,,,,,"Projects and blockchains are required to submit a proposal, which TWT holders are then able to vote on. If the proposal passes a certain threshold, then it is integrated into the Trust Wallet core. Voting takes place through Snapshot. Voting power is equal to the amount of TWT held in users's wallet (1 TWT = 1 Vote) and does not charge users a fee. The app submits a snapshot of the wallet’s Smart Chain address when user’s cast a vote, which means that voting power is affected if TWT is moved from the account before the voting period ends. All details about the voting process are available here.

Proposals must demonstrate their value to the Trust Wallet community and are encouraged to incentivize TWT holders to vote by offering bonus rewards. This could be in the form of special offers, token airdrops or giveaways. All details about how to submit a proposal are available here.

The Trust Wallet Team is ultimately in charge of deciding which community proposals make it to the voting round as governance proposals. The team will not consider any proposals that do not adhere to their template and do not demonstrate the following factors:
Total amount of votes is equal to at least 4% of the total TWT BEP-20 circulating.
51% or higher voted “Yes”.

By enabling shared control, DYDX aligned incentives between traders, liquidity providers, and partners of the Layer 2 protocol. DYDX enables a robust ecosystem around governance, rewards, and staking – each designed to drive future growth & decentralization of the dYdX Layer 2 protocol. Two staking pools also launched alongside DYDX  designed to promote liquidity and safety on the dYdX Layer 2 protocol. Rewards programs for trading and liquidity provision on the dYdX Layer 2 protocol, and for past usage of all dYdX protocols will help drive growth and adoption of the dYdX Layer 2 protocol. DYDX holders also receive trading fee discounts based on the size of their current holdings, more on this can be found here.

In order to protect protocol solvency, dYdX introduced a safety module that functions as an insurance vault and a governance booster. In return for depositing into safety pools, DYDX stakers receive a liquid version of their position, stkDYDX, which carries the same governance rights as DYDX. With the highly successful governance proposal, protocol included stkDYDX into their trading rewards and liquidity provider rewards calculation formulae to incentivize long term participation of the DYDX token holders and thus keep the native token in the dYdX ecosystem.",Centralized Distribution,"A total of 1,000,000,000 DYDX have been minted, and will become accessible over five (5) years, starting on August 3rd, 2021 at 15:00:00 UTC. The initial five-year allocation of the total supply of  DYDX is as follows:50.00% or 500,000,000 to the community as follows: 

25.00% or 250,000,000 to users who trade on the Layer 2 Perpetuals Protocol, based on a combination of fees paid and open interest 
7.50% or 75,000,000 to past users who complete certain trading milestones on the Layer 2 protocol - 7.50% or 75,000,000 to liquidity providers based on a formula rewarding a combination of uptime, two-sided depth, bid-ask spreads, and the number of markets supported 
5.00% or 50,000,000 to a community treasury 
2.50% or 25,000,000 to users staking USDC to a liquidity staking pool 
2.50% or 25,000,000 to users staking DYDX to a safety staking pool 
27.73% or 277,295,070 to past investors of dYdX Trading 
15.27% or 152,704,930 to founders, employees, advisors, and consultants of dYdX Trading or the Foundation 
7.00% or 70,000,000 to future employees and consultants of dYdX Trading or the Foundation 

A maximum perpetual inflation rate of 2.00% per year will increase the supply of DYDX beginning after five years, ensuring the community continues to have the resources to continue contributing to the Protocol.","[{'title': 'Seed Round', 'start_date': '2017-12-19T05:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private, accredited-only', 'details': 'dYdX [raised](https://medium.com/dydxderivatives/dydx-raises-seed-round-led-by-andreessen-horowitz-and-polychain-capital-f15d0e9ca16a) a $2 million equity seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital with the participation of numerous angel and seed investors, including Brian Armstrong, Fred Ehrsam, Elad Gil, Scott Belsky, Avichal Garg, Kindred  Ventures, Abstract Ventures, and 1confirmation.', 'end_date': '2017-12-19T05:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': None, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 2000000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Series A ', 'start_date': '2018-10-19T04:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private', 'details': 'dYdX [raised](https://medium.com/dydxderivatives/dydx-raises-10m-series-a-1250b7e0e1df) a $10 million round led by Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital with the participation of Craft Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, Naval Ravikant, Kevin Hartz, Dragonfly Capital, and VY Capital.', 'end_date': '2018-10-19T04:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': None, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 10000000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Series B', 'start_date': '2021-01-26T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private, accredited-only', 'details': 'dYdX [raised](https://medium.com/dydxderivatives/dydx-raises-10m-series-a-1250b7e0e1df) a $10 million round led by Three Arrows Capital and DeFiance Capital with the participation of Wintermute, Hashed, GSR, SCP, Scalar Capital, Spartan Group, and RockTree Capital.', 'end_date': '2021-01-26T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': None, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 10000000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Series C', 'start_date': '2021-06-15T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private, accredited-only', 'details': 'dYdX [raised](https://medium.com/dydxderivatives/dydx-raises-10m-series-a-1250b7e0e1df) a $65 million round led by Paradigm and introduced top-tier strategic investors from liquidity provision, market-making industry, and the crypto VC industry.

The initial supply of DYDX tokens will be subject to a 5-year distribution period. Half of it will be distributed through a reward mechanism for staking, liquidity provision, retrospective milestone completion, and trading on the platform. These rewards will become liquid every 28 days.

After 5-years, token holders will be able to propose an increase in DYDX token supply through governance. The perpetual inflation rate for this proposal is capped at 2% per year, meaning that there is a fixed maximum for the arbitrary inflation adopted by dYdX governance.

",Inflationary,"Dynamic Emission, Other Burn & Mint models",,1000000000.0,,N/A,,,,,,,,"The dYdX Governance Process is fueled by governance forums at forums.dydx.community and ratified through dYdX Improvement Proposal (“DIPs”). Off-chain dYdX Request for Comments (DRCs) creation is the first step in the governance improvement process. Anyone can participate in the Governance Forum, create off-chain DRCs, and discuss improvements. To create a DRC, use this template (available on our Github). The DRC should cover all the information of the potentially final DIP. At a minimum, DRCs must include: 
Short and concise titles of the DRCA short and concise description of the proposal, 
The rationale for the DRC. E.g. why?, 
The title of the forum post must include DRC: with the short title of the DRC. E.g. DRC: New Market Request, 
A community poll that community members can use to vote on improvements off-chain.

Once posted on the governance forum, all questions and comments should be addressed & taken into consideration, to further improve the DRC. Once an off-chain DRC has a very rough consensus, a community member holding more than 10,000 DYDX can create an off-chain vote for the DRC on Snapshot. Snapshot is a simple voting interface that allows users to signal sentiment off-chain. Votes on snapshot are weighted by the number of DYDX delegated to the address used to vote. The DRC submitter will need to provide details of the DRC, a voting system, vote start date, vote end date, and snapshot block number. The Snapshot block number locks the state of community members who are able to vote. Token holders who hold tokens before the snapshot block number are eligible to vote. Snapshot poll lengths should be set to 5 days. When a rough consensus is reached, an on-chain DIP may be submitted by a community member who holds enough proposition power for the type of proposal. As soon as the voting period ends and a proposal has succeeded, anyone can call the queue to begin the timelock delay. For the Starkware priority timelock executor, it has a priority period of 7 days out of the 9-day timelock delay. This means that after 9 days anyone can execute a proposal, but within days 2-9 (the priority period) Starkware has the option to execute the proposal.","Direct On-Chain Vote, Delegated On-Chain Vote","An on-chain DIP is initiated via a smart contract call. The proposal should be based on the winning outcome of the off-chain DIP voting on Snapshot and can consist of one or multiple actions, up to a maximum of 10 actions per proposal. After an On-Chain DIP is created, the proposal enters a pending state for a period defined by the Voting Delay, which is currently configured to 6570 blocks or approximately 1 day (assuming 13 seconds per block). In other words, user snapshots are recorded 1 day after the DIP is created, at which point the proposal transitions to an active state. After the Voting Delay, the Voting Period is activated. The voting period length depends on the proposal type. After a DIP is created on-chain it is subject to a Voting Delay, Voting Period, Minimum Quorum, and a minimum Vote Differential. The parameters can be found [here](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/voting-and-governance/dip-proposal-lifecycle). As soon as the voting period ends and a proposal has succeeded, anyone can call the queue to begin the timelock delay. For the Starkware priority timelock executor, it has a priority period of 7 days out of the 9-day timelock delay. This means that after 9 days anyone can execute a proposal, but within days 2-9 (the priority period) Starkware has the option to execute the proposal.",True,,

NANO is the native currency within the Nano network and can be used for peer-to-peer payments and value storage within the network. It’s feeless nature makes it suitable for micropayments and it’s speed make it suitable for B2C transactions.

Nano’s ledger technology is made up of multiple blockchains, one per each account, allowing the network to asynchronously process upwards of 100 NANO transactions per second with little electrical energy expenditure. In order to interact with Nano to send and receive feeless payments, users may use Nano specific wallets or multi-coin wallets such as Atomic Wallet.",Faucet,"Nano implemented a unique way to distribute NANO by implementing a ‘faucet system’ whereby users solved complex CAPTCHA tests and were awarded NANO upon completion. The intent of such a system was to enable anyone with a computer to participate in order to distribute NANO ‘as fairly and organically’ as possible; by contributing time and effort as opposed to hash power. 

The faucet distributed 17,000 NANO/hour to the top CAPTCHA solvers. Those outside of the top 100 had their claims roll over until they had completed enough CAPTCHAs to be rewarded. Users were given the choice to donate part of their reward to the development fund, no amount of coins were reserved for the fund outside of these optional donations.

On October 20, 2017 the CAPTCHA faucet was shut down in order for the project to focus attention towards protocol development. At this time, the CAPTCHA faucet had distributed only 126,248,289 NANO of the initial planned supply of 340 million.

Representatives do not receive financial rewards for securing the network, becoming a representative is entirely volunteer based. The incentive to become a Nano representative is based entirely on helping secure the network and was put in place in an attempt to promote decentralization at scale and avoid centralizing forces when a monetary reward for securing a network is introduced. 

To become a representative, one must run a node and enable voting; keeping the node online to vote for the validity of transactions. At any time, accounts can select a representative of their choosing to vote on blocks on their behalf by updating their account chain.

There are two types of representatives; Representatives and Principal Representatives. Representatives share their votes directly with connected peers and rebroadcast votes from Principal Representatives. In order to become a Principal Representative, a Representative must have enough ‘voting wait;’ meaning, the sum of received account balances delegating to them is at least 0.1% of received account balances delegated to currently online Principle Representatives. In addition, Principal Representatives have a more extensive minimum recommended specification for node hardware.

The MobileCoin team has stated that they are awaiting approval from their lawyers before they do so. On September 15, 2021, the CEO confirmed that the self reported circulating supply number on CoinMarketCap was correct at 74,218,324. This has not been verified independently nor has it been updated since.

What is known is that after the Mainnet's initial launch, 15% of the supply was given to the Seed Investors and the remaining 85% was given to the MobileCoin Foundation to be distributed. Joshua Goldbard, MobileCoin CEO, has stated in forum posts that over 50% of the supply will be available to be purchased directly from MobileCoin through their website. Goldbard has also stated that the intention is for MobileCoin to have a minority of all coins and to get them ""into circulation as quickly as possible"". 

As of August 2021, it became possible to directly purchase MobileCoin at www.buymobilecoin.com for anyone outside the United States. The website has a purchase limit of $5k annually per user and it's unsure how long this restriction will last. Using this information, a rough estimate of 3,000,000 MOB entering circulation each month can be assumed.

Based on the information known, the following supply breakdown can be done:
Seed Funding: 15%.
Investors: 19% (Derived based off MobileCoin's valuation after funding rounds; No information on lockup period).
Airdrop: 0.04% (Livestream events have been held where the team has been airdropping MOB to Signal user attendees in the UK. The amount airdropped or planned to be airdropped is unknown).

The MCP solves the Byzantine Agreement Problem by requiring each user to specify a set of peers that they trust, called a quorum. Quorums are based on the real-life trust relationships between individuals, businesses, and other organizations that compose the MobileCoin Network. There is no central authority in the MobileCoin Network. Users accept statements about the blockchain ledger when their quorum convinces them that these statements are true.

The MobileCoin Consensus Protocol avoids the environmentally-damaging mathematical “work” required by Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocols like Bitcoin and realizes a much higher transaction rate than the Bitcoin consensus protocol. In contrast to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus protocols, practical control of governance in MCP is ceded to the users who are trusted the most by the extended MobileCoin community, rather than to the wealthiest users who control the largest financial stakes. MCP ensures that all operators agree on the sequence of valid payments that are completed. New transactions are grouped in blocks and published approximately once every five seconds to the MobileCoin Ledger.

The initial number of tokens is five billion. All of these tokens were locked at mainnet launch and released gradually in monthly intervals. These initial tokens were divided between the following parties:

Core Team
Private Equity Investors: A max of 600 million CFXs were allocated to private investors. In the last investment round, CFX tokens are sold at $0.1 per CFX. Any unsold tokens in this category were re-allocated as Foundation Holdings.
Foundation Holdings: 200 million CFXs plus any unsold CFXs in the previous category will be allocated to support the long-term financial need of the Conflux Foundation. These tokens will be unlocked monthly over two years.
Genesis Team: 1.8 billion CFXs will be awarded to the founding team, including the IIIS team (of Tsinghua University) and Alt-Chain Technologies shareholders (where Conflux spun off from), Conflux Foundation employees, and advisors. The Genesis Team tokens will be unlocked over four years.

Community and Ecosystem Building
Community Fund: 400 million CFXs will be used for marketing and community building. These tokens will be unlocked over four years.
Ecosystem Fund: Two billion CFXs in the Genesis Issue will become an ecosystem fund to solve cold start problems and to invest in applications building on the Conflux network.

Inflation
Conflux has two ongoing emissions mechanisms:
Mining Rewards: Conflux offers financial incentives for system maintainers or miners. When the Conflux mainnet launched, the initial base block reward was seven CFX per block, with blocks mined approximately every 30 seconds. Conflux’s block rewards will gradually reduce over measures of time called epochs. Epochs are phases in the Tree-Graph’s life cycle. At epoch height 3,615,000, the Conflux block reward will be reduced to two CFX per block. There is currently no plan for a halving event since the block rewards are reduced. When the four-year mark approaches, there will be a governance vote to decide on a second halving.
Staking Inflation: CFX holders can stake their tokens on the Conflux Network and earning staking rewards for their contributions. Users must stake their tokens for a fixed period of time to purchase votes in Conflux Network governance. The network emits network tokens to stakers at an annual rate of roughly 4%.",Inflationary,Fixed Inflation Rate,,,"Conflux Network achieves consensus through a novel mechanism called Tree-Graph. This consensus protocol optimistically accepts all formally correct blocks and organizes them as a Tree-Graph (instead of a tree or a chain), and then specifies a total order of blocks in the Tree-Graph following the Greedy Heaviest Adaptive SubTree (GHAST) rule. This total order will be agreed upon by honest participants and is theoretically hard to undo under reasonable assumptions, according to the Conflux team. After fixing the order of transactions, transactions inside blocks are executed accordingly while invalid transactions (duplicates or conflicting previously processed transactions) are ignored.

Conflux aims for Tree-Graph to be:
Scalable: Its transaction order mechanism allows the network to reach a range of 3,000-6,000 transactions per second with relatively low transaction fees
Secure: Transaction ordering is theoretically hard to cheat under reasonable assumptions
Versatile: It also uses Proof-of-Work (PoW) for reentrance attack protection at the protocol level

All Conflux Network Ecosystem Participants can obtain voting rights by locking up their tokens for a specific time on Conflux Network's [Staking Page](https://governance.confluxnetwork.org/en/). After obtaining voting rights (lock-up votes), users can vote on proposals listed on the Conflux Network [Governance Page](https://governance.confluxnetwork.org/en/governance/). The specific voting rights rules can be found in the Conflux Network Whitepaper in Chapter IV - Token Rules, Section F - Voting Rights. 

__On-Chain Governance Process__
1. Proposal Initiation: To initiate a governance vote, the initiator's lock-up votes must exceed a certain percentage of the ecosystem's total voting rights when the vote is requested. Initiated votes are listed on the Conflux Network Governance Page.
2. Proposal Vote: After the proposal is online, anyone with lock-up votes can participate in the vote.
3. Vote Results: Token-weighted voting procedure determines the final result of a vote.
4. Proposal Implementation: After participants have reached a consensus on a vote, the results will be final. The final result will be implemented, and the implementation time varies depending on the complexity.",,,

The DigitalBits Core software interacts with a chosen subset of other instances of cores in order to validate and agree on the status of every transaction through the DigitalBits Consensus Protocol (DCP) which is based on the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP). Similar to Stellar’s SCP, DCP relies on a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA). Unlike the Byzantine Algorithm, the FBA does not have a single list of trusted validators (e.g. a centralized list of trusted validators). Instead, Federated Byzantine Agreement allows for different quorums or sets of validators to co-exist. Individual nodes determine the composition of the quorum in a decentralized manner. 

DigitalBits Core instances of different institutions can choose to participate in one or more quorums subject to the existing quorum members agreeing to grant it access. The quorums facilitates the compliance process based on legal requirements. Organizations may choose one or more quorums that satisfy their requirements.

Participants can only spin up a node by (1) committing to staying online and accessible to users and (2) staking a sufficient amount of NU tokens on the network as collateral. Once the network confirms an operator's NU security deposit, these nodes can provide re-encryption services to users in exchange for new token emissions and network fees (paid in ETH). NuCypher designed its token model to give NU's low liquidity, thereby encouraging users to stake their tokens long-term rather than use their holdings to speculate on price.

NuCypher: Mining & Staking Economics",Private Sale,"NuCypher launched back in 2015, but it did not look to tokenize its data encryption layer until 2017. Despite some early rumblings of an initial coin offering (ICO), the team opted not to pursue a public token sale. Instead, NuCypher ran a SAFT (dubbed by some as a ""token pre-sale""), raising $4.3-4.4 million in Dec. 2017, selling 31% of its initial token supply.

In Oct. 2019, NuCypher raised <a href=""https://messari.io/article/nucypher-raises-10-7-million-as-its-public-test-network-goes-live"">$10.7 million</a> in another SAFT, this time selling 8% of its token supply at a valuation of $133 million. Investors agreed to ""stake-lock"" their tokens for two years, implying these buyers will stake NU tokens and run nodes on the network for the first two years post-launch before they can sell.

Upon mainnet launch, NuCypher intends to distribute NU tokens to users via its WorkLock mechanism. Unlike initial coin offerings (ICOs), airdrops, or Merkle mines, WorkLock requires users to escrow  ETH in a designated smart contract to acquire a proportional amount of NU. Users can recoup their ETH deposit if they stake their NU tokens and produce some amount of work. Otherwise, participants will forfeit their escrowed ETH. The team designed the WorkLock method to distribute tokens to meaningful contributors, and to maximize network participation, an area airdrops fail to address. Details on the token supply available via WorkLock are not available yet.

NuCypher will mint 1,000,000 NU tokens at launch, with at least 39% of the supply dedicated to SAFT investors. The second round of SAFT investors, who hold 8% of the initial supply, agreed to ""stake-lock"" their tokens on the network for a minimum of two years post-launch. Other users will be able to acquire NU tokens near NuCypher's mainnet launch by way of the WorkLock distribution mechanism. The NuCypher has yet to release how many tokens will be made available to WorkLock participants.

NuCypher staking rewards
The network will reward early stakers with newly minted NU. The inflation rate, however, is not static and will depend on how long participants intend to stake their tokens. As part of the network's design, NU stakers must declare the length of the staking period, a metric that nodes can increase at any time but cannot decrease. The minimum staking period is one month. If all nodes commit to the minimum staking duration, the inflation rate will be 50% APR (annual percentage rate). On the flip side, if all nodes commit to staking long-term (over one year), the inflation rate will be 100% APR.

This inflation rate will also decrease exponentially on a daily basis, and the effect of this daily decay is a function of the network's average aggregate staking period as well. Per its paper of mining and staking economics, NuCypher estimates the inflation rate will halve sometime between two years (if all nodes commit to staking for more than one year) and four years (all nodes commit to staking in one-month intervals).

Like Bitcoin, XCH block rewards will theoretically ensure the network's economic security by aligning the interest of Chia ""farmers"" with what is best for the protocol. Block rewards are earned by farmers when completing Proof of Space and Time transactions for the network. XCH tokens are used for these payments as well as natively as transaction fees (""gas"").

Multiple wallets exist for Chia token which further support its adoption. The project maintains a wallet as part of its full-node software, which provides the highest degree of security. That said, multiple wallets which offer ease-of-use and installation have emerged including light-wallets. Chia maintains its own light-wallet available here. Third-party wallet apps include Goby and Nucle, which are maintained independently from Chia though remain open-source.",Centralized Distribution,"Pre-Launch Equity Rounds

Chia Network did not hold a public token sale or ICO. It raised several private equity rounds (through a SAFE or Simple Agreement for Future Equity agreements) before its launch, but the company did not sell any XCH to these investors. However, investors will have the right to redeem a portion of Chia’s Strategic Reserve based on the then market price of XCH if the Company:
Hasn’t attempted to file a registration statement in the two years after mainnet launch
Hasn’t effectively registered the Company’s equity within three years from the date of the mainnet launch
These funding rounds extend from pre-seed funding in 2017 through to Series D funding as late as 2021 for over sixty million US dollars. According to the team, no investor has been promised XCH in return for their investment. Certain investors have redemption rights on Chia’s Strategy Reserve if Chia Network does not list its equity for public trading over certain time frames.

SAFE Conversion

Chia Network announced in February 2022 that, as planned, investments allowing for token distributions have been converted into preferred equity with cash redemption privileges instead.

Strategic Reserve

Chia Network (the company) expects to create 21 million XCH at mainnet launch, forming Chia Network’s Strategic Reserve or “pre-farm.” It will use this reserve to invest in the company’s long-term value and the Chia Network blockchain. The exact amount of tokens required to execute the company’s efforts to drive the adoption of Chia are unknown. Chia Network eventually intends to take the company public, making it less reliant on its Strategic Reserve of XCH tokens. If successful in the public market and the markets for XCH are sufficiently liquid, it could distribute XCH to shareholders with equity buybacks or XCH coin dividends.

Plans for the Strategic Reserve include:
Lending: The company intends to lend XCH to their customers and market makers for use in day-to-day commerce and creating liquidity in the market.
Additional Farming Rewards: The company can offer special bonuses to Chia farmers. As an example, it plans to reward farmers in the final pre-launch farming contest with XCH once transactions are enabled on mainnet.
Investing: Making investments in promising developers, platforms, and service providers creating applications and tools for the Chia blockchain.
Share Buybacks: Similar to a dividend. When Chia is traded, the company may offer to redeem equity through the payment of XCH to stockholders.
Dividends: The company, solely at the discretion of the Board of Directors, may dividend XCH directly to its stockholders to, in part, encourage the use and promotion of Chia Network’s blockchain.
Following the network's mainnet launch in March 2021, farmers on Chia Network are now earning XCH tokens as compensation for their mining operations.","[{'title': 'Seed Funding', 'start_date': '2017-09-05T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Seed Funding', 'details': 'Chia Network announces its first fundraise, with a seed private investment worth an undisclosed sum invested by Meltem Demirors.', 'end_date': '2017-09-05T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': None, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': None, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Series A', 'start_date': '2018-03-28T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private Equity', 'details': 'In March 2018, Chia Network raised a $3.4 million seed round led by AngelList founder Naval Ravikant, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz and Greylock, among others.

The Chia Network will mint 64 new XCH assets every ten minutes for the first three years after mainnet launch, which would total 3.36m XCH per year. Supply emissions will undergo a halving every three years until the network has completed four halving events. Once issuance is cut for the fourth time, the block reward will remain at that value in perpetuity.

The exact emission schedule is as follows:
64 chia will be minted every ten minutes between 2021-2023
32 chia will be minted every ten minutes between 2024-2026
16 chia will be minted every ten minutes between 2027-2029

Blocks are generated by allocating storage space on a plot, and their value (i.e., empty block or transaction block) is determined by the quality of the proofs which is directly affected by computational power. While storage is used to remove the high-intensity CPU workload of traditional Proof of Work mechanisms, limited computations are required to secure the Proof of Space primitive design (namely via the time-focused verifiable delay function, VDF).

With this in mind, becoming a Chia farmer maintains relatively low barriers to entry. Considered the effective minimum requirement, farmers can deploy a Raspberry Pi 4 as a full-node (though performance may be limited). The stated requirements therefore are:
1.5GHz+ quad-core CPU 64-bit
4.0GB+ RAM
101.0GB+ storage space
Python v3.6 to v3.9 (inclusive, free)
With these criteria satisfied, see here the detailed instructions for starting to farm. Initialization of the Chia Network plot (reference size 100GB) may take anywhere from six to twenty-four hours. Thereafter, farmers can start earning XCH with their rig. Note, farming for Chia remains a particularly intensive I/O activity and therefore may result in degraded performance or failure of storage drives.

Smaller-scale farmers, which encompasses a presumably large portion of the network participants, would benefit from exploring participation in pools.",Other,Proof of Space and Time,18.75,,,2024-03-19T00:00:00Z,,,"Off-chain governance is the primary means of circulating and advancing new ideas for Chia Network. Chia Network with its PoST consensus mechanism does not rely on governance afforded by Proof of Stake. Therefore, upgrades occur when the majority of farmers upgrade to the latest software releases leaving no direct on-chain governance.

Discussions surrounding upgrades to Chia occur on both the Chia Developer Forum and GitHub repositories. Additionally, backlog and priorities may be accessed publicly via the development team's Trello board. Private developers are free to contribute to Chia Network, which would start by opening a Git pull request on that GitHub repository. Git version management is also employed by Chia Network as the commercial developers, thereby making GitHub the primary off-chain governance venue.

Introduced in February 2022, the Chia Improvement Proposal (CHIP) is a standardized process for improvements not unlike the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) or Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) standards.",No On-Chain Governance,"Chia governance refers to the process by which protocol rules are decided upon, implemented, and enforced. Like Bitcoin, Chia nodes can adopt new rules according to their subjective views on what the network should be. If two or more individuals adopt the same set of rules, they form a social consensus of what the network is. It gives node operators a say in the future direction of the network. Protocol changes are legitimized when a majority of users agree to adopt the new changes by upgrading their nodes to the latest client release.",,,

At the core of COTI’s infrastructure lies the Trustchain, a consensus algorithm based on machine learning. The consensus algorithm assigns each user on the network a Trustscore and combines it with standard Proof of Stake to reach global network consensus. COTI’s DAG-based decentralized ledger achieves scalability by using parallel source selection and Trust Scores. The higher a user’s Trust Score, the faster the confirmation time.

The Trustchain lies on a decentralized DAG data structure with no coordinator, centralized council, or other central governance. The collective Trustchain network consists of Full Nodes, Double Spend Prevention (DSP) Nodes, Trust Score Nodes, and History Nodes. The Trustchain works by creating a trust layer over the DAG coupled with a ranking mechanism to track the behavioral data of network entities. Users are ranked according to trust and are assigned a trust score. Fees decrease the more trustworthy a user is, while the speed of processing a transaction increases. The inverse is also true, thus improving the security and overall trustworthiness of the network.

Eligibility to run a node 
To be eligible to run a Full Node, operators must stake 100,000 COTI for each node and set the fee they wish to charge per transaction. An operator may also stake 250,000 COTI to run an Advanced Node and guarantee a 25% annualized return. COTI node operators are incentivized for their services in a way that is designed to be fair, efficient, and flexible and is based on fee distribution mechanisms and staking requirements.",Other,Proof of Trust,,,,,,,"The COTI Group is currently leading the development of COTI's protocol and ecosystem, including planned updates.

The Fetch.AI token is the native asset for the Fetch.AI network and is required for all network exchanges, as a refundable method of registering with the network, for staking, and as a mechanism for delivering value back to those performing work on the network.

The Fetch.AI token enables the protocol's autonomous economic agents to perform specific tasks. Fetch.AI’s token allows agents access to the digital world in the form of services, data, infrastructure, or access to data processing such as AI and ML algorithms.

Fetch.AI tokens are designed with various purposes including:

Operational Costs
Operation costs in Fetch.AI are decoupled from the Fetch.AI token in a similar way to that of “gas” on the Ethereum network, but with additional functionality designed to increase the stability of such “gas costs” and look at addressing issues associated with high and low-velocity economies. Fetch.AI’s operational fuel allows access to processor time for contract execution and services for agents.

Ability to connect agents and nodes to the network. 
This is an access deposit token that acts as a form of stake to demonstrate desire to behave appropriately. It modulates the ability for bad actors to flood the network with undesirable nodes or agents due to the escalating cost of doing so. 

Access and exchange value
The Fetch.AI token is required for agents to perform exchanges of value (data, service, etc). Since FET is divisible, low-cost and microtransactions are possible within the network. FET is needed to access, view, and interact with the network and digital world. Agents, which can represent digital entities, require FET in order to access aspects of the network.

Machine learning and Synergetic Computing services
The Fetch.AI token enables the development of and access to a broad range of machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks that are available on the ledger. These may be primary services, developed by Fetch.AI, such as trust and prediction models, or they may be large-scale independently developed services for network users. Fetch.AI refers to these collectively as Synergetic Computing.",Initial Exchange Offering,"Founded in 2017, and launched via IEO on Binance in March 2019, the Fetch.ai mainnet went live in Jan 2020.","[{'title': 'Seed', 'start_date': None, 'type': 'Private', 'details': None, 'end_date': None, 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.0341, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 2058587, 'is_kyc_required': True, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'SAFT 1', 'start_date': None, 'type': 'Private', 'details': None, 'end_date': None, 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': 'ETH', 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.0652, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 7426.5, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 724975, 'is_kyc_required': True, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'SAFT 2', 'start_date': None, 'type': 'Private', 'details': None, 'end_date': None, 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': 'ETH', 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.0694, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 14448.99, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 250000, 'is_kyc_required': True, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Saft 3', 'start_date': None, 'type': 'Private', 'details': None, 'end_date': None, 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': 'ETH', 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.0735, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 2721, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 449917, 'is_kyc_required': True, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Binance Initial Exchange Offering', 'start_date': None, 'type': 'Public', 'details': None, 'end_date': None, 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.0867, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 6000000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}]",,[],,[],116452755.0,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': None, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': None, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': None}",2019-12-01T05:00:00Z,,,"Fixed Supply, Inflationary",Fixed Inflation rate,True,1152997575.0,"The Fetch.ai consensus is built using a unique combination of cryptographic and multi-agent systems theory. These unique features can be further extended to many other applications such as IoT and decentralized machine learning to enhance the capabilities of the Fetch.ai network.

Fetch.ai believes that blockchains require a time-to-finality rate that provides a comparable experience to current centralized payment systems. The finality problem is a technical limitation of blockchains that has acted as a barrier to wider adoption of blockchain technology.

Fetch.ai’s dynamic consensus is designed to help blockchains achieve finality sooner, making networks more efficient. Fetch.ai plans to assist non-blockchain applications with time-stamping activities in real-time.

The consensus mechanism uses unique tools that Fetch.ai has developed for generating decentralized and incorruptible sources of randomness. These cryptographic techniques can be used as oracles in applications that involve coordinating multiple stakeholders in areas such as finance, gaming, and logistics. Unbiased randomness can, for example, be used to choose which trades should be matched in decentralized exchanges, deal cards in a decentralized game of poker, or decide which company in a transport consortium should fulfill a delivery. Fetch.ai claims that this consensus mechanism will support both existing industrial applications and blockchain-enabled applications.

Incorruptible randomness is also key to the Fetch.ai Minimal Agency (min-agency) consensus, which is designed so that all users have fair access to the protocol. This is achieved by ensuring that individual validators have very little influence over which transactions reach the global state and their eventual ordering.

Minimal Agency consensus utilizes a hybrid system that combines some features of DAGs and blockchain-based ledgers.

The min-agency consensus uses a DAG to continuously synchronize transactions and ensures that all participants in the network can commit transactions to the global state at any time. In general, DAGs come with various tradeoffs including greater storage costs from holding redundant information and non-ordered transactions which poses some challenges for implementing smart contracts. Various DAG-based protocols implement solutions to help alleviate these tradeoffs.

The min-agency consensus collapses the DAG at regular intervals which occurs when a validator adds a signature (notarizes) vertices that have been validated by at least half of all validators. Subsequently, all of the transactions that have been notarized are converted into a block that is added to the blockchain to finalize the transactions.

In min-agency consensus, the ordering and choice over which transactions are added to the block is made by a deterministic algorithm that also uses cryptographic randomness. Fetch.ai asserts that min-agency consensus will improve fairness and censorship resistance thereby preventing abuses such as validator front-running users in decentralized exchanges.",Proof-of-Stake,Minimal Agency Consensus,,,,,,,"Fetch.ai is a Singaporean foundation with four principal trustees each with one vote in a multi-sig wallet.

Request calls its token the pillar of ""Request Independence"" as it allows the network to be blockchain agnostic, run simultaneously on multiple blockchains, and even have a possibility of running its blockchain. The key takeaway being the token allows the network to be independent both from the currency and the infrastructure of third-party service providers. 

The current and planned usage of the token includes:

Anti-spam: By having a transaction fee for every request 
Governance: For voting on-chain
Staking: For deploying and operating a node.  
Discounts: For providing a discount on financial transactions
Independence: REQ is independent of currency and technical infrastructure

Request leverages decentralized networks such as Ethereum and IPFS for security, privacy, and data ownership on behalf of the user. This requires that small transaction fees need to be paid at every step whenever a change is broadcasted to the blockchain network. The collected fees are sent to an Etherum smart contract called ""Burner"" to be burned periodically, in turn lowering the total amount of REQ tokens in existence. While the REQ tokens are burnt on the Ethereum mainnet, transactions are mainly processed through the xDai Stable Chain. On xDai they are locked in a contract before being moved back to the Ethereum mainnet where they are burnt.

The REQ burn mechanism helps in aligning technology adoption and stakeholders’ interests as increased adoption decreases REQ supply. Additionally, as no new tokens can be minted, this makes REQ a deflationary mechanism on the total token supply of 1 billion.",Initial Exchange Offering,"The ICO was launched on Oct 17, 2017, Request raised $32,895,000 by selling 500,000,000 REQ tokens at a price of ~$0.0672.

The unique feature of the token is that it combines DEX, and Lending & Leveraged Trading in-turn promoting liquidity by attracting more inflows into the project. The token has five main features:

1) Trade Token - The exchange is an automated market maker (AMM) that helps users swap between two tokens
2) Farm Token - Trader Joe helps users to earn JOE tokens by staking their liquidity provider (LP) tokens
3) Stake Token - Staking JOE tokens will help in earning more JOE via protocol fees
4) Borrow Token - Users will be able to lend and borrow tokens from Trader Joe, to earn yield or increase their trading leverage  
5) Governance - Allow holders to vote on community proposals

Token Rewards:
• 0.05% of all trades are paid to xJOE staking pool 
• A share of fees from lending interest and liquidations is paid to the xJOE staking pool (% to be determined) 
• JOE token holders can stake their JOE to xJOE and receive a share of the revenues",Fair Launch,"JOE tokens will be issued through liquidity provider rewards, as there were no pre-sales, seed investors, or VC allocations. The token distribution follows a fixed supply, decaying emission model and will be distributed as per the emission schedule i.e. that the team and treasury funds will be distributed alongside LP farms. 

Trader Joe also has an allocation hold out for future investors. It means that if Trader Joe were to raise investor funds in the future, these investors would enter after the token launch, and not before. In addition, team tokens were locked and couldn't be taken out from the contract for 3 months post-launch.

Each JOE held via xJOE tokens equal 1 JOEVOTE 
Each JOE token is worth 1 JOEVOTE 

Voter eligibility will be determined by holding JOEVOTE from any of the above or all 3 at the time when voting starts.

First, it is used by dApps to pay hosting fees, similar to how tokens on Ethereum are used. Second, it is considered the standard currency in Chromia. DApps can use CHR to collect fees or use it as a reserve currency to peg their token to. Third, the token provides an incentive to providers to not collude, as they all have a stake in the ecosystem. Fourth, Chromia uses CHR for system-wide purposes. Chromia likes to call the CHR token the 'bread and butter' of Chromia.

When the Mainnet launches, CHR will convert to a native token. ","Private Sale, Initial Exchange Offering","Upon launch of the system, one billion (1,000,000,000) tokens will be created. No tokens will be created in the future. Initially, 70% of all tokens will be owned by ChromaWay. These are to be sold, awarded to team members, invested, or used in some other way. 3% will be put in the automatic conversion contract from CHR to ETH, and vise versa. 2% will be locked in a system node compensation pool. 25% will be allocated for promotional use.   

Within the ChromaWay pool, 25% of the tokens will be sold to select partners. The rest of the pool, which is 45%, will be locked and slowly released. The whitepaper states that up to 17% will be unlocked the first year, then 12% thereafter. ChromaWay has committed to holding its tokens for three years. Following the three years, Chromia development and governance must transition to a decentralized model, per the whitepaper.   

In May 2018, Chromia held a private sale for the select partners. The private sale accepted USD, ETH, and BTC. It raised: 
138,351.25 USD 
23.37 BTC

The subset of nodes will run a BFT consensus algorithm, most likely using a PBFT-like algorithm. This algorithm will provide definite finality. The next layer of security is that all sidechains will be anchored to a PoW blockchain - such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. This can be done cheaply, mainly one Bitcoin transaction every few blocks, and guarantees that Chromia is at least as strong as Bitcoin (if that PoW chain is chosen).   

All Chromia software will run on nodes, which are physical or virtual computing power. The nodes are controlled by an individual, organization, or collective, and are known as a provider. Users in the Chromia ecosystem will then connect to the nodes.

In November 2020, Chromia introduced staking and Chromia Proposals. As a staker, you will gain access to the proposals platform to vote on decisions and the direction of the project. However, these proposals have no formal power. They are simply implemented as a beta governance model and to give the core developers community feedback.",No On-Chain Governance,,,,

PERP tokens can be used to vote or propose new ideas to improve the protocol. Currently, critical decisions are made by the core developers to keep governance nimble in the early days of the protocol. The team has created a detailed plan to transition governance to the community as the protocol matures.

Staking
Token holders can lock-up their PERP for a fixed amount of time to the Staking Pool. Stakers get rewarded through staking rewards and are eligible to claim a portion of the transaction fees generated during the epoch proportional to the number of tokens staked.

PERP stakers should be aware of 5 things when staking their tokens:
Stakers must stake their tokens for a fixed amount of time. During this time, know as “epoch”, stakers are not allowed to withdraw their tokens. Each epoch lasts 7 days.
A transaction needs to be submitted if a staker wishes to withdraw their staked tokens.
Staking rewards are time-weighted, meaning stakers are free to stake their tokens anytime during the epoch but will only receive a portion of the stake incentives.
Transaction fees can be claimed right after the epoch, but the staking rewards are locked until the first day of the same month in the following year.
If a staker doesn’t unstake their tokens at the end of the epoch, the tokens will automatically roll over to the following epoch.",Liquidity Mining,"Perpetual protocol initially created 100,000,000 PERP tokens with a max supply of 150,000,000. 7,500,000 were distributed via a Balancer Liquidity Boosstrapping Pool on September 9th, 2020.

The operation of Ontology requires support from various types of nodes to provide network security and stability. Network nodes receive ONG payments for any operational costs to incentivize operator participation. These payments originate from Ontology users, who pay ONG to Ontology network nodes to request Ontology services. The services that network nodes provide include transactions, network storage, deployment and execution of smart contracts, and use of other resources in Ontology. ONT holders requesting Ontology network nodes periodically pay ONG in operation costs to maintain the ongoing operation of the network.

ONG, is divisible up to nine decimal points.

Ontology tried to create a positive feedback loop by utilizing a dual-token design. This design uses ONT for staking and ONG as gas.

It is used as a settlement layer for the trades of assets originating from multiple blockchains. As Sifchain's continuous liquidity pools are constructed to have Rowan traded against another external asset, users will always need to interact with Rowan if they are willing to trade on Sifchain's decentralized exchange.  There is also a network fee paid in Rowan when trading on Sifchain.  When users resort to Peggy to transfer their Rowans from Sifchain to the Ethereum Network, their Rowans become eRowans, one-to-one representations of Rowans.

Sifchain has a delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that requires agents to have Rowan in their wallets to become blockchain validators. Other participants of the Sifchain network can delegate their Rowan by staking through validators and earn rewards from block finalizations. Alternatively, when Sifchain introduces SifDAO after launching on mainnet, users will be able to participate directly in protocol governance by owning Rowan, or indirectly by delegating their tokens as well as their voting power. ","Airdrop, Crowdsale","Sifchain distributed the rights of 32.5% of the total Rowan supply through three private investment rounds in 2020. On February 19, 2021, Sifchain launched on BetaNet with a public token sale event run on the Ethereum network to distribute 70 million eRowans within 7 days. The registration period to participate in the sale was from January 11 to January 29 and required investors to complete KYC. During the sale period, Sifchain employed a TVL model with a bonding curve that updated the token price with each transaction and limited the maximum percentage that can be purchased from the pool in a single trade to 2%. The pool started with 8,750,000 eRowans and was fueled with an additional 364,000 eRowan every hour for seven days (168 hours) in total until February 26. At the end of the round, $26,370,000 USDT was collected in exchange for 64.2 million eRowans.

Although Sifchain doesn't currently use this feature, once it launches IBC, it will initiate inflationary block rewards to incentivize validators.

Apart from the tokens distributed during the public sale, circulating supply increased with the rewards for Liquidity Mining and Validator Subsidy Programs, and airdrops. At least 66.5% of the total supply will get unlocked one month after Sifchain launches on mainnet.",Inflationary,Dynamic Emission,,1000000000.0,"Sifchain uses Tendermint's Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism with certain additional use case-specific adjustments and creates a secure and dynamic trading environment. Like THORChain, Sifchain has an Incentive Pendulum that balances the reward structure for both validators and LPs. The network is in a balanced state when the value of Rowan staked by validators is twice the value of all assets deposited in liquidity pools. If the value of staked Rowan rises above this level, validators will receive fewer rewards while LPs will receive more. This shift encourages users to deposit more assets into liquidity pools. The opposite outcome will occur if the value of staked Rowan falls below twice the value of assets within liquidity pools. Sifchain actively observes the validators on its network, punishes those who participate in malicious activity by slashing its staked tokens and permanently banning them from the consensus set (top hundred nodes measured by the total staked amount that are responsible for validation). The protocol updates its consensus set every block to maintain an active and reliable consensus mechanism. Since Tendermint is a PBFT consensus mechanism, it takes a block as finalized after getting the approval of 2/3 of the validators. In this way, it is more reliable compared to chains that offer probabilistic block finalization. Currently, validators are rewarded with the network fees in each block, therefore no additional token gets minted during the validation process. However, after the Validator Subsidy program ends, Sifchain will enable its dynamic inflation mechanism and reward validators with freshly minted Rowans.

Further information on how to become a validator can be found here.",Proof-of-Stake,Tendermint BFT,,,,,,,"Once Sifchain launches on mainnet, the team will introduce its community-driven and computer-aided governance (CAG) agent, SifDAO. While at first, the team will continue the software development and market strategies with off-chain governance, the token holders (by either owning or being delegated to tokens) will make decisions on the key protocol aspects such as additional features and network parameters. The CAG mechanism that SifDAO plans to use will aim to facilitate the community's decision-making process by simulating the possible outcomes of proposals and thus avoiding preventable negative outcomes. The team is currently working with UC Davis and Metagov to bring the most suitable governance model to Sifchain, which will expectedly include restructuring the governance specifics regularly and integration of alpha bonds prediction markets to enable on-chain economic incentives for SifDAO members.",Upcoming,,,,

A pool of “Genesis Tokens” (SGT) was created to give to early contributors that clearly showed they wanted to help the platform grow, which were given out at the discretion of the core devs. This token pool corresponded to a maximum of 10% of the total token supply. After the contribution period, SGT could be converted to the ICO token (SNT) so early contributors could “get in” on the ICO token for being a contributor early. Basically, early disbursement of tokens that map to a given percentage of the total.  
A soft-cap and subsequent “Dynamic Ceilings” were implemented which meant large investments only got a portion of their investment accepted, and the rest was refunded. This was an attempt to increase the time window for smaller investors, and slowly make it more difficult for large investments to get in. The effect of this was for every transaction that got an amount kicked back, there are one regular transaction and two internal transactions.
Status raised a total of 299,902.24 ether (ETH) from 20,000 accounts during its token sale. Status tokens were distributed as follow:
6.9 % was allocated to Status Genesis Token Holders:
44.1 % was allocated to ICO investors
20.0% was allocated to Status Core Dev:
29.0% was reserved for future use","[{'title': 'Initial Coin Offering (ICO)', 'start_date': '2017-06-19T10:00:00Z', 'type': 'Public', 'details': 'Dynamic ceilings', 'end_date': '2017-06-19T10:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 3000947747, 'asset_collected': 'ETH', 'price_per_token_in_asset': 0.0001000014672, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.04, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 299902.24, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 107113084, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}]","[{'name': 'Token Sale Summary', 'link': 'https://blog.status.im/status-contribution-period-recap-36e64d35d3e4'}, {'name': 'Token Sale Analysis', 'link': 'https://medium.com/the-bitcoin-podcast-blog/a-look-at-the-status-im-ico-token-distribution-f5bcf7f00907'}]",[],,"[{'category': 'Core Development', 'amount_in_percentage': 50}, {'category': 'Security', 'amount_in_percentage': 15}, {'category': 'Operations', 'amount_in_percentage': 15}, {'category': 'Marketing', 'amount_in_percentage': 10}, {'category': 'Legal', 'amount_in_percentage': 10}]",6804870175.0,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': 51, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': 49, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': 0}",,,"Status' outstanding supply is fixed.

This token serves the following purposes:
Transaction Fees: Clients pay fees in CTSI to node operators for their transactions to get processed, transmitted, and temporarily stored by others. 
Block Producer Selection: To become a block producer, users must stake CTSI tokens. Block producers are selected to propose news blocks in proportion to their token balance. Miners are selected at random according to a PoS (Proof of Stake) system and gain the right to create the next block.
Staking: Stakers receive CTSI rewards by staking their tokens and participating in the network.
Challenge Computations: CTSI will also be used to challenge computation results posted on the blockchain. It will work as an exit mechanism that helps guarantees the correct execution of applications and discourage bad behavior.

CTSI also plays a role with Descartes Rollups. It will be used by applications to outsource the execution of verifiable and enforceable computation to entities running Descartes nodes.","Initial Exchange Offering, Private Sale","Cartesi has a total fixed supply of 1 billion CTSI.

To ensure Moonriver works as an accurate testbed for Moonbeam its token function is designed to be very closely aligned with the sister chain.

Usage of the MOVR token on Moonriver includes:
Paying for transaction fees on the network
Supporting the gas metering of smart contract execution
Incentivizing collators and powering the mechanics around the creation of a decentralized node infrastructure on which the platform can run
Facilitating the on-chain governance mechanism including proposing referenda, electing council members, voting, etc",Parachain Crowdloan,"The initial genesis supply of MOVR tokens is 10 million. A portion of the network tokens have been reserved to ensure the network secures and maintains a parachain slot on the Kusama network. A significant portion of the network (30%) was fairly and permissionlessly distributed as part of the initial crowdloan. The remaining balance will be distributed to teams building on Moonriver and held by the Moonbeam Foundation to support long-term protocol and network development. Notably, there is no “founders reward” and the PureStake team developing Moonriver will not own any of the tokens at network genesis.
Further allocation details are below:
Parachain crowdloan: 3,000,000 (30%)
Community initiatives and parachain slot reserve: 4,000,000 (40%)
Parachain bond reserve: 50,000 (0.5%)
Treasury: 50,000 (0.5%)
Long-term Network Stewardship & adoption: 2,450,000 (24.5%)
Developer adoption program: 450,000 (4.5%)",[],,[],,[],10000000.0,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': 0, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': 29, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': 71}",2021-06-29T00:00:00Z,2021-06-29T00:00:00Z,"Moonriver will target a 5% annual inflation rate and has an uncapped token supply.

The purpose of inflation in Moonriver is to pay for the ongoing security needs of the network. The primary security budget items are to pay for a parachain slot on an ongoing basis and incentivize collators to provide collation (block production) services to support the network. Of the 5% inflation, 1% will go towards incentivizing collators and 1.5% will go to the parachain bond reserve to accumulate on-chain funds to pay for a parachain slot in perpetuity. The remaining 2.5% will go to users that stake their RIVER tokens and help support the collator selection process.

Fees on Moonriver related to transactions and smart contract execution will be processed in two ways. 80% of the spent fees will be burned, while 20% of the spent fees will go to the on-chain treasury, which can be allocated via on-chain governance to projects and initiatives.",Inflationary,Fixed Inflation rate,False,,"Moonriver uses a hybrid consensus protocol based on Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS), which provides deterministic finality. Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) is also known as Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS).

In Polkadot & Kusama, there are collators and validators.
Collators maintain parachains (in this case, Moonriver) by collecting transactions from users and producing state transition proofs for the Relay Chain validators. The collators set (nodes that produce blocks) are selected based on the stake they have in the network. For finality, Polkadot/Kusama rely on GRANDPA validators. GRANDPA validators provide deterministic finality for any given transaction (block). When a block/transaction is marked as final, it can't be reverted except via on-chain governance or forking. Moonriver follows this deterministic finality.
Collators are members of the network that maintain the parachains they take part in. They run a full node (for both their particular parachain and the relay chain), and they produce the state transition proof for relay chain validators.
Moonriver uses the Nimbus Parachain Consensus Framework. This provides a two-step filter to allocate collators to a block production slot:
The parachain staking filter selects the top 52 collators in terms of tokens staked in the network. This filtered pool is called selected candidates, and selected candidates are rotated every round
The fixed size subset filter picks a pseudo-random subset of the previously selected candidates for each block production slot.",Delegated Proof-of-Stake,Nominated Proof-of-Stake,6.0,,,,,,"Moonriver emulates Moonbeam governance structure both on and off-chain to ensure alignment.

Guiding ""soft"" principles for engagement with Moonbeam's governance process include:
Being inclusive to token holders that want to engage with Moonbeam and that are affected by governance decisions.
Favouring token holder engagement, even with views contrary to our own, versus a lack of engagement.
A commitment to openness and transparency in the decision-making process.
Working to keep the greater good of the network ahead of any personal gain.
Acting at all times as a moral agent that considers the consequences of action (or inaction) from a moral standpoint.
Being patient and generous in our interactions with other token holders, but not tolerating abusive or destructive language, actions, and behaviour.
These points were heavily inspired by Vlad Zamfir’s writings on governance.",Direct On-Chain Vote,"The ""hard"" governance process for Moonriver will be driven by an on-chain process and will leverage the Democracy, Council, and Treasury Substrate frame pallets, similar to how Kusama and the Polkadot relay chain are governed.
The purpose of these modules are to allow the majority of tokens on the network to determine the outcomes of key decisions around the network. These decision points come in the form of stake-weighted voting on proposed referenda. Some of the main components of this governance model include:
- Referendum: a proposal for a change to the Moonriver system including values for key parameters, code upgrades, or changes to the governance system itself
- Voting: referenda will be voted on by token holders on a stake-weighted basis. Referenda which pass are subject to delayed enactment such that people that disagree with the direction of the decision have time to exit the network
- Council: a group of elected individuals who have special voting rights within the system. Council members are expected to propose referenda for voting and have an ability to veto publicly-sourced referenda. There are rolling elections for council members where GLMR holders will vote on new or existing council members. The Council is also responsible for electing the technical committee
- Technical Committee: a group of individuals elected by the Council who have special voting rights. As in Polkadot and Kusama, the Technical Committee has the ability to (along with the Council) fast-track emergency referenda voting and implementation in urgent circumstances. A fast-tracked referendum can be created alongside existing active referenda. That is to say, an emergency referendum does not replace currently active referenda
- Treasury: A collection of funds that can be spent by submitting a proposal along with a deposit. Spending proposals must be approved by the council. Rejected proposals will result in the proposer losing their deposit",True,,

Require deposit to activate the Metis Virtual Machine (MVM) to create a decentralized autonomous company (DAC)
Staked collateral within the Meta Staking Contract when users intend to build up collaborations with others, which will form the commitment foundation for the Optimistic Governance
Any transactions leveraging Metis protocol on layer-2 will use METIS as the gas cost

More Details
The Metis token (METIS) operates as the internal currency for staking and payments. Users can pay for goods and services offered through Decentralized Autonomous Companies (DACs) built on the Metis protocol.

METIS tokens also play a role in reducing spam and ensure trust between developers and users alike. Users must stake some amount of METIS to start a collaboration with others on the platform, such as the founding of a DAC. These tokens will be returned to the initial users if the collaboration is successful. Unsuccessful collaborations can lead to users losing their stake (akin to slashing penalties). Collaborators will also be paid and rewarded in METIS for the contributions.

Users can stake a certain amount of METIS tokens to participate in the Ranger DAC. Stakers in this DAC will be assigned a random range of transactions from all DACs along with the starting state roots. These stakers (called ""Rangers"") will compute and submit the state root to the base layer. Rangers will get rewarded or penalized based on the challenge process, which allows users to dispute the validity of a state root submitted to the base layer. Rangers will also be able to mine METIS as part of this process.","Airdrop, Initial Dex Offering, Private Sale","The initial distribution of METIS is as follows:

Ongoing Emissions
The remaining 47.7% of the supply will be minted over ten years to support the protocol's transaction mining program. About 31% of this total (1,486,400) will be released in the first year following Metis' mainnet launch. The remaining 69% will be emitted over the course of the following nine years.",Inflationary,,True,10000000.0,"Rollup construction
In Metis, transactions are sequenced and batched by a pool of sequencers. These sequencers are randomly selected to ""roll up"" the state roots and submit the transactions to the underlying layer-1. At this base layer, Metis deploys a set of contracts that coordinate the commitment of batches of layer-2 to layer-1.

Economic Incentives
Each sequencer needs to stake METIS Tokens to qualify for the role. The protocol uses a Dynamic Bond Threshold (DBT) to link the risk and reward of malicious behavior to each sequencer's staked value, which should disincentivize undesirable sequencer actions. The DBT is managed by the DACs involved in the transactions.

The DBT is calculated using as a base the maximum economic capacity of the DAC assigned to a sequencer. The economic capacity of a DAC is computed according to its total balance. If the number of staked METIS by a particular sequencer is below the DBT for the DAC it is assigned to, it won’t be able to batch transactions for that DAC. A DAC’s sequencing is blocked until an eligible sequencer is found in the sequencer pool. New deposits or withdrawals of funds from the DAC’s balance trigger automatic updates to its DBT. New withdrawals to the DAC balance will reduce the required DBT of sequencers, and vice versa for new deposits. This relationship aims to ensure that the required sequencing collateral follows the real economic value of a DAC.

Verification
For verification purposes, the Metis platform introduces the concept of ""Rangers"" in its virtual machine (dubbed the MVM). Layer-2 Rangers are members of a special DAC that are responsible for sampling a range of blocks and validating the state roots according to the transactions assigned by a random DAC. Rangers validate sequenced transitions for other DACs and their own DAC. Each completed validation from a Ranger is rewarded with METIS tokens. A successful challenge (i.e. fraud-proof) to a state of the chain awards the validator a portion of the “malicious” sequencers bond. But a failed challenge will cause the Ranger validator to lose the bond and eventually lose access to the MVM_RANGERS DAC.",,,,,,,,,"Before mainnet launch, the core team and co-founders at the MetisLab Foundation will be in charge of the technical and product development direction for Metis. Other team members carry out the day-to-day operations and development of the project. Governance rights will be transferred to the community once the base infrastructure is production-ready.",Upcoming,,,,

Ultimately this agency will enable holders to dictate what happens with the treasury. The community will be responsible for activating network token rewards for token holders. Governance decision-making and proposals will be geared around the following: 1. Technology 2. Products and Projects 3. Token Distribution 4. Governance Structure. All YGG holders may propose initiatives through the YGG website and governance forum. Tokens *may* be issued to those who propose succesful initiatives. 

YGG plans to integrate subDAO's, or game-specific governance bodies. SubDAOs will be tokenized, with a portion of the tokens offered to the broader YGG community. The assets within the YGG treasury are accessed via a multi-signature wallet. SubDAO members, with their protocol-specific expertise, are able to acquire and employ productive NFTs to better ends. An example of the subDAO structure is the issuance of the YGGLOK token. YGG acquired League of Kingdoms land parcels which are held within the YGG treasury and accessed via multi-sig. This multi-sig will be tokenized as a subDAO and offered to members of the community. ALL YGGLOK token holders can vote on economic activities within League of Kingdoms and participate in the returns of those activities.",,,

It also must be staked by service providers to sell bandwidth to protocol users. The primary use cases of the OXT tokens are to purchase bandwidth for private Internet access and for staking by bandwidth providers.

The Orchid Network also provides a novel payment framework that enables per packet payment of traffic. Node operators are paid using probabilistic micropayments that are cashed in by node operators in return for OXT. This system incentivizes node operators to earn OXT for their excess bandwidth. Probabilistic micropayments are used to ensure network security and randomization of incentives for Orchid Node Providers (i.e. anyone with a computer or set of servers). 

The Orchid Network supports two primary actors:
Bandwidth Provider - Once the network reaches a full state of decentralization, anyone will be able to operate an Orchid Node. A user becomes a node by installing the Orchid client, connecting their device as a node (or set of nodes), and staking OXT tokens to increase chances of reward in the network. Bandwidth contributors can participate by staking Orchid tokens (OXT), which grants traffic requests, enables a decentralized supply-side identification (ie authentication), and adds a security incentive mechanism to the network.
Bandwidth Consumer - Users install Orchid VPN and add Orchid tokens to their wallet, which allows them to access the internet through a user-chosen path. Behind the scenes, a user pays Orchid tokens (OXT) and receives claim “tickets” on their chosen VPN provider pool. Claim tickets payout one in every ten thousand where each ticket is a valid nano payment that pays out Orchid tokens (OXT) to bandwidth contributors in the P2P bandwidth marketplace. Users only pay for the bandwidth they consume.",Private Sale,"To date, Orchid Labs has raised $48mm on an offered $125mm Reg D offering.

Purchasers received 120 ANT per ETH, a 20% discount over the public sale price, and were subject to a 6-month vesting schedule with a 3-month cliff. Institutional buyers CoinFund, ICONOMI, and ShapeShift could contribute the equivalent of $40,000 in ETH, while personal buyers could contribute up to $10,000 ETH. For liquidity purposes, ShapeShift was allowed to purchase an additional $20,000 ETH worth of ANT which were not discounted or subject to vesting. 

This enabled Aragon to fund the necessary development and operations to make the public sale possible. Presale proceeds were allocated as follows: approximately 50 ETH to security audits, approximately 208 ETH to legal expenses, approximately 107 ETH to public relations, approximately 134 ETH to advertisements, approximately 212 ETH to Ethereum name service, and approximately 15 ETH to miscellaneous expenses. 

The public sale ended on May 17, 2017, after raising 275,000 ETH (roughly $25 million at the time) at a rate of 100 ANT per ETH. Public sale contributors were not subject to vesting or lock-up periods. Aragon stated that 70% of the ICO proceeds went to purchasers, 15% to the Foundation and the remaining 15% to the founders and early contributors who have worked on the project. A hidden cap mechanism was employed prior to the token offering to attract smaller buyers and ensure a more even token distribution and longer sale period. However, the founders made the decision to reveal the hidden cap, which was 275,000 ETH, before the sale’s start due to the large queue of transactions threatening the Ethereum infrastructure. The cap was hit in less than 30 minutes. 

Upon the close of the offering, the total supply of the network was 39.6 million ANT. Aragon stated that the total supply will be constant only until Aragon’s network is deployed. From then on, network governance will decide the monetary policy and inflation rate going forward.",,,,,,n/a,,,,n/a,,,,"Aragon Association, a non-profit verein registered in Switzerland is solely responsible for managing funds raised from the token sale.

Users that hold REP are rewarded for their participation in reporting on the correct winning outcomes. REP is needed by market creators and reporters when they submit the outcome of the market. Users that hold REP and participate in the reporting of outcomes are entitled to a portion of the fees collected in the market. The fees are distributed proportionally by the amount of REP a user holds.,Crowdsale,"Augur pre-sold 80% of total supply (8.8 million REP) in a public sale from Aug. 17, 2015, to Oct. 1, 2015, raising a total of $5.3 million. The funds are intended to support development, operations, maintenance, and logistical expenses. The sale targeted early evangelists of the Augur vision because REP buyers would serve as the oracles to report on the outcomes of predicted events.

The remaining 20% of tokens (2.3 million REP) were pre-allocated to the founding team, advisors and the Forecast Foundation. The price a buyer paid for REP was determined based on the final price sale the token sale completed, plus the discount provided in the buyer’s respective round. The sale was conducted in four rounds:

The first round, called the True Augur round, lasted from Aug. 17 to Aug. 22 during which participants received a 15% bonus. 
The Prophet round lasted from Aug. 22 to Aug. 28 and offered a 10% bonus. 
The final bonus round, the Nate Silver round, offered a 5% bonus from Aug. 28 to Sept. 5.

API3 Inflation
API3 maintains a floating target inflation rate to achieve high enough staking rewards to attract a target amount of API3 staked that are ultimately securing the protocol. The API3 tokens that are staked act as an insurance fund. The inflation rate is currently unknown as it will be set by the API3 DAO. ",Inflationary,Programmatic Burn,,,,N/A,,,,,,,,"To decentralize the governance of both decentralized APIs and the project as a whole, API3 is governed by a DAO. The governance is entirely decentralized and open, meaning that all stakeholders are able to participate in the governance of the project directly. 

The DAO votes on high-level parameters regarding mechanics such as staking incentives and collateralization. Additionally, the DAO gives out grants from the DAO bank and by consequence decides on the general direction of the project. More granular tasks are conducted through hierarchical team structures for scalable governance. Any team or individual adding value to the protocol can apply for a grant from the DAO. Examples include: buiseness development or marketing teams, front-end and protocol developers, educators, legal counsel, and a wide range of other tasks.",Direct On-Chain Vote,API3 is governed by it's DAO via a direct on-chain vote. ,True,,

Of the total raised, $10 million was in ether (ETH) and more than $15 million was in bitcoin (BTC) which was received from individuals and institutional funds including BlockTower Capital, Kryptonite1, and Pantera Capital. 

Contributions surpassed the ICO hard cap, but as outlined in the FunFair whitepaper these contributions were still allowed. This resulted in the generation of just over 17.17 billion FUN tokens. The public accounted for 21.3% of all total FUN tokens (3.65 billion) while the remaining tokens were distributed to the founders (13.4% or 2.30 billion), Advisors (1.0% or 184.8 million), and the FunFair Foundation Trust (64.3% or 11.04 billion). Tokens distributed to the founders are subject to an 18-month vesting schedule ending in Dec. 2018. 

The FunFair Foundation Trust is responsible for the ongoing phase two of the token sale and plans to distribute the remaining tokens at undefined later dates using a Dutch auction model. FunFair has stated the sale of FUN tokens will not exceed one billion FUN tokens annually, with FunFair reserving the option to burn any or all of the unsold tokens. The FunFair Foundation Trust has already burned just over 6 billion FUN tokens, diminishing the max supply to 11 billion FUN tokens. FunFair has previously stated on their website that tokens unsold in phase two auctions will be issued to phase one token holders on a pro rata basis.

The Radicle DAO is made up of RAD token holders that govern the network’s Ethereum based smart contract system. One can become a DAO member by acquiring and holding RAD. In exchange, holders can vote on governance proposals that control the protocol's smart contracts and the Radicle Treasury, which holds the majority of RAD supply.

Radicle users can opt-in to the Ethereum integration and are subject to fees when utilizing some of its smart contracts. These fees accrue in the Radicle Treasury. RAD token holders receive discounts or waived fees in certain circumstances. Users can also pay for services and fund development teams using RAD tokens.","Initial Dex Offering, Private Sale","RAD tokens were initially distributed through an LBP on Balancer and a private sale for early supporters of the project.

The private sale for early supporters distributed eight million RAD at $1.50 per token, raising $12 million. The funding round was led by NFX and Galaxy, with participation from Placeholder, Electric Capital, and ParaFi Capital. Angel investors Naval Ravikant, Balaji Srinivasan, and Meltem Demirors also participated.

Radicle's LBP ran from Feb. 25-27, 2021. It initially offered 3,750,000 RAD (3.75% of token supply) to purchasers at a starting price of $11.50 (in USDC). The price ranged from $9.76-$28 over the two-day sale, with an average sale price of $15.40. The LBP raised $24,774,879 in USDC.

The LBP only sold 50% (or 1,875,000 tokens) of the RAD allocated to it. After a snapshot poll, the community decided to unpause the Balancer pool which allowed it to function as a regular DEX as the pool weights had converged to exactly 50/50. Thereafter, an official governance proposal was executed that removed liquidity from the pool and transferred the remaining tokens to a RAD/USDC pair on Uniswap.","[{'title': 'Early Supporters', 'start_date': '2021-02-18T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Token Sale', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2021-02-18T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 8000000, 'asset_collected': 'USD', 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 1.5, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 12000000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP)', 'start_date': '2021-02-25T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Initiate DEX Offering', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2021-02-27T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 1875000, 'asset_collected': 'USDC', 'price_per_token_in_asset': 15.4, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 15.4, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 24774879, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 24774877, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}]",,[],,[],100000000.0,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': 22.75, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': 26.25, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': 50}",2021-02-15T00:00:00Z,,"In February 2021, Radicle released the Radicle (RAD) ERC-20 token.

In order to become an official Governance Proposal eligible for on-chain voting by RAD holders, a proposal must follow four phases;
1. __Temperature Check:__ Informal discussion introducing the topic to the community on the [Radicle forum](https://radicle.community/).
2. __Structured Discussion:__ Formal discussion on the Radicle forum including a detailed proposal draft that addresses the technical implementation as well as the feedback generated from the Temperature Check.
3. __Formal Review:__ A five-day [snapshot poll](https://snapshot.org/#/gov.radicle.eth) of the draft proposal. The poll can be a yes/no question or include multiple-choice options. The option with the highest amount of votes moves forward to governance proposal development, or the proposal is archived if the majority voted against the proposal.
4. __Governance Proposal:__ Executable code that must be professionally audited before being [voted for on-chain](https://gov.radicle.network/#/proposals/radicle). A delegator with at least 1% of RAD delegated to their address can create a proposal. The voting period is 3 days and RAD holders must delegate their vote to delegators (or delegate to themselves) in order to cast a vote.

SPA is primarily used to mint Sperax USD. SPA is also used for voting purposes, transaction fees, etc. SPA is the native currency for the Sperax network and allows users to pay for network transactions. Sperax has initially issued SPA tokens as ERC-20s on Ethereum. 
","Crowdsale, Private Sale","Token Sales & Initial Distribution
Sperax raised a private round fundraising of $6.1 million in November 2019, led by Outlier Ventures, Amber Group, FBG Capital, and Ryan Zurrer. The project later raised $200,000 in a public sale in March 2020. In August 2020, Sperax raised another $5 million in a public sale that sold about 5% of the network's total supply.

The initial distribution of network tokens is as follows:

Treasury (25.00% of total supply) — The SPA treasury will vest linearly over a 4-year time-lock, beginning from the launch date of governance protocol. The DAO will control this fund and utilize for future partnerships, marketing incentives, liquidity mining rewards, etc.
Foundation (25.02% of total supply) — Foundation funds are being used to make initial markets and for future protocol development. Since the foundation lends the tokens to third parties for market making activities, the actual token balance held in the foundation wallet will fluctuate.
Team and Advisors (9.98% of total supply) — This vests linearly over 4 years with a 6 month cliff. Vesting started on 3/18/2021 for existing team members. For new members, vesting would start from the day they join.
Private Sale (15.00% of total supply) — Allocation of SPA from the private sale has begun under a strict vesting schedule of 1 year starting from 9/18/2021.
Staking rewards (10.00% of total supply) — This will be used to reward users who stake $SPA in the staking protocol. Stakers will earn fees from the minting and redeeming of USDs, as well as staking rewards from the allocated rewards budget. Since the fees collected from USDs minting and redeeming will be less initially, this allocation will ensure early stakers are amply rewarded. The initial proposal distributes these rewards over 4 years starting from the launch date of the staking protocol. Allocation for each of the years is 40% + 30% + 20% + 10%, with daily emissions of SPA for the stakers. Emissions rate will be governed by the DAO and can be modified in the future.
Bootstrap Liquidity (10.00% of total supply) — This will be used to provide rewards for liquidity mining during protocol genesis. Future liquidity mining rewards will be funded from treasury funds if the DAO deems fit.
Public Sale (5.00% of total supply) — The public sale took place on August 16th, 2020 and 5% of total supply was sold.

The ERC-20 token can be earned in the form of rewards, pledged by enterprise partners and paid as fees by the platform users. A breakdown of the token's uses is highlighted below.   

Ecosystem incentives & Rewards: Early and active usage of the protocol is rewarded through regular payouts of incentives to propel the adoption of the ecosystem's products and services. Enterprise participants, like e-commerce platforms, financial institutions and other payment companies, are rewarded according to their transaction volume and network size. Consumers may earn rewards through fee discounts and other spending rebates. Also, all participants are eligible to earn DeFi rewards by either staking or providing DeFi services within the ecosystem.   

Platform Access: Enterprise partners pledge a certain amount of ACH tokens to be able to access and make use of Alchemy Pay's services. This pledge amount is dependent on the partner's projected transaction volume and client network size. A partner who wishes to cancel their access would be reimbursed the pledge while defaulting and fraudulent partners may forfeit their pledge when access is revoked. Token holders can also make pledges to gain access to different tiers of DeFi products and services.   

Decentralized Governance and Value-added Voting: Token holders are given the privilege to vote on protocol decisions and key changes, in proportion to their ACH holdings. Asides from governance, there may be other non-governance voting scenarios such as opinion polls and contests where ACH holders can participate in.",Centralized Distribution,"ACH token was pre-mined at its maximum supply of 10 billion tokens on September 4, 2019.

Collateral/Stake for Validators: All validators are required to stake BAND, with a higher stake equating to a high probability of being selected to fulfill data requests. Underperforming or malicious actors will result in having their tokens slashed.
Transaction and Access Fees: BAND tokens are used to pay as a transaction, query fee, and also for data access behind paywall (private APIs).

If a delegator does not cast their vote, their would-be votes are automatically cast in the same manner as the validator’s votes.",,,

MNGO was initially distributed through a public IDO and can now be bought on secondary markets such as Orca, Raydium, and Mango. The majority of MNGO (90%) is locked in the DAO treasury in which token holders vote on how the funds should be utilized. Discussions on the governance forum include: proposed listings for accepted collateral types and markets, treasury allocations, changing a market's interest rate model, applying for grants from Mango, and marketing related proposals to help build the protocol's user base.
","Fair Launch with Built-in Treasury, Initial Dex Offering","Mango decided to forego a traditional raise from venture capitalists. Instead, it opted for an IDO open to the public. On August 10th, 2021, 5% of the total MNGO supply (500,000,000 MNGO) were up for sale to anyone who possessed SPL-USDC and a Solana native wallet. There were two token vaults, one for users to deposit USDC and one that held 500,000,000 MNGO tokens. The amount of USDC deposits in the vault determined the price per MNGO during that time. The launch had two stages each lasting 24 hours. During the first stage, users were able to deposit and withdraw USDC into and out of the vault. During the second stage, or the ""grace period,"" users could only withdraw USDC, meaning the price of MNGO could only go down. This allowed users who no longer wanted to purchase MNGO to withdraw their investment, while also letting whales with large amounts of capital artificially inflate the price. At the peak of the IDO there were 570M USDC in the vault, pricing MNGO at $1.14 per token. After the grace period finished, the majority of this capital was withdrawn resulting in a much lower price per MNGO. Upon completion, the IDO raised 70M at $0.14/MNGO. All proceeds went directly to the DAO treasury for use as an insurance fund in the event of extreme volatility causing excess losses in the system. It is important to note the investors listed (Multicoin & CMS) participated in the IDO & bought at the same entry price as retail users.

The founding team proposes the tokens are distributed in a halving cycle similar to BTC, with a halving every two years instead of four. Ultimately the DAO will be responsible in choosing to enact or forego this proposed distribution model. The DAO is also responsible to determine the future incentive programs utilizing the MNGO token.",Fixed Supply,,True,10000000000.0,,Proof-Of-Stake,,,,,,,,The only off chain governance is the ability to post in the forum. All remaining aspects of Mango governance are handled on chain.,Direct On-Chain Vote,"Governance proposals are made on the Mango governance forum which is separated into four categories: grants, listings, governance, and feedback. Anyone with .1% of Mango tokens staked (1M MNGO) can create a proposal. In order to vote for or against a proposal, one must lock MNGO tokens in a smart contract for what is called the ""voting period."" Any Mango token staker can vote for or against proposals. Official proposals are not merely suggestions; they are are executable code.  A minimum of 2% of the total MNGO token supply needs to be cast in order for a proposal to be eligible for approval.  All proposals are subject to a 3 day voting period. If a majority and at least 2% of the total Mango Token supply are cast for the proposal, it is queued in the timelock and can be implemented after 2 days.
According to Co-Founder Maximillian Schneider, all protocol upgrades will be handled by a ""developer multi-sig"" starting the third week of December 2021. As of today, the core developers are able to update the Mango v3 program at will, posing a security risk to the DAO.",True,,

Each year a fixed amount of 300,600 tokens are minted to compensate maintainers and developers performing work for the network. MLN also acts as “asset management gas”. Holding MLN is not a requirement by the user and this step is abstracted away from them by a <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts"">smart contract</a>. Functions that currently utilize and burn MLN on the network include setting up a fund, requesting investment and redeeming assets. Any projects building application layer on top of MLN are free to include other uses on MLN on top of the gas layer (eg. staking).

The buy + burn model of the protocol assures that as usage on the network increases, more asset management gas is consumed and therefore more MLN burned. This is a framework designed to align the growth of the network with the value of the token.                                                                                                     

Furthermore, a pool of 300,600 MLN is available every year for projects who want to apply for a grant.

When users interact with an amgu (asset management gas unit) payable function on the Melon protocol, they pay asset management gas in ETH to the Melon network. The total asset management gas paid is equal to:
  Number of amgu consumed  amgu price
The ETH paid for amgu* fees by users is then sent to the Melon Engine. The Melon Engine contract sells ETH and buys MLN at the engine price. The engine price includes a premium over the ETH/MLN market price (market price is retrieved through <a href=""https://messari.io/asset/kyber-network#profile"">Kyber network</a>). The MLN bought through the Melon Engine is instantly burnt. 

The amgu price can be adjusted when necessary by the Melon Council DAO, in case of a massive network usage spike or period of extreme volatility on MLN/USD. The idea is to keep the Melon gas price at competitive levels compared to other asset management alternatives. 

It also offers the Melon Council DAO the ability to control the supply dynamics of MLN. Indeed, the amount of MLN burned is directly correlated to the number of amgu consumed and the amgu price. As such, periods with high activity will lead to an increasing number of MLN burnt. In case the deflation rate is too high, the Melon Council DAO can adjust down the amgu price. 

The supply curve was drawn to reflect this burn & mint mechanism. Several hypotheses were taken into account:
A growing number of funds managed on the Melon Protocol, especially in the first 10 years. From 1,000 funds in 2020 to 20,000 in 2026, 40,000 in 2033 and 59,000 in 2050.
A fluctuating amgu price throughout the years, fixed at a low level in the first two years (0.0000005 MLN) to incentivize usage, and raised during the subsequent years (0.000002) before slowly declining to reduce the deflation rate (0.000001).
To go further, the Melonomics blog posts provide a comprehensive deep-dive on MLN economics.   ",Burn & Mint,Other Burn & Mint models,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,"After two years of development, Melonport AG handed off governance of the protocol to the Melon Council, a <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/dao"">Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)</a> comprised of two parts: the Melon Technical Council (MTC) and the Melon Exposed Business (MEB) representatives. 

MTC is initially appointed by the Melonport AG team and will grow by a two-thirds majority vote of the Melon council. Incoming applicants must have proven technical expertise, no conflicts of interest, willingness to dedicate time and reveal their identity. The technical council is responsible for deployment of protocol upgrades, management of ENS subdomains pointing to smart contracts, allocation of resources to developers, and adjusting network parameters. Members will be compensated with 20% of the inflationary rewards. 

MEB exists to ensure a voice to those whose businesses rely on Melon and its future development. This includes fund managers with a minimum threshold of assets and other applications and projects using the protocol. MEB is intended to balance the power of the MTC by checking their decisions and electing delegates to represent their interests on the Melon council.",,"The Melon Council DAO is built using aragonOS, giving members an [interface](https://aragon.mainnet.aragonpm.com/#/0xfe1f2de598f42ce67bb9aad5ad473f0272d09b74) to interact with the DAO on-chain.

IDO whitelisting - Community members participate in IDO listing unless they hold a certain amount of POLS in their wallet or provide liquidity. During the initial days, members should hold a minimum of 3000 POLS or provide ETH-POLS (1ETH and equivalent of POLS) liquidity to be eligible for participating in the IDO. The whitelisting process has changed over time. Currently, a member should hold at least 250 POLS over a week time to get an entry ticket in IDO. The more entries they have, the higher their chances of successfully being whitelisted. Additional information about whitelisting and the IDO process is available in this guide.
Governance -  Token holders will be able to vote on product features, token utility, types of auctions and even decide which projects get to be featured by Polkastarter
Fees: Transaction fees will be paid in $POLS
Staking for Reward Pools  - Token pools on Polkastarter will incur a fixed fee, paid by the pool creator. Staking rewards will also be distributed in 24-hour cycles. If a user holds 2% of the total staked POLS during that 24-hour cycle, that user will get the equivalent of 2% of all the staking rewards for that same period. Polkastarter network users are only eligible for staking after providing liquidity to the Polkastarter pools. Contributors can lose their staking status if they stop providing liquidity to the network.
Staking for Pool Access - Pool creators can activate POLS staking to limit pool access exclusively to POLS holders. The incentive for this type of behavior from the pool creator is a reduced fee on the total swapped funds
Liquidity mining - Tokens for liquidity mining have been taken from the Liquidity Pool.  22,500,000 (22.5%) has been assigned for liquidity. Liquidity includes liquidity providing for secondary markets, but also the liquidity mining rewards. Total liquidity mining rewards are yet to be determined.","Private Sale, Liquidity Mining","Polkastarter raised a total of $875,000 from seed fund and private funding backed by <a href=""https://messari.io/organization/ngc-ventures"">NGC Ventures</a>, Moonrock Capital, Signum Capital, and Astronaut Capital.","[{'title': 'Seed Funding', 'start_date': None, 'type': 'Private Sale', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2020-08-30T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 15000000, 'asset_collected': 'USD', 'price_per_token_in_asset': 0.0125, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.0125, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 187500, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 187500, 'is_kyc_required': True, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Private Sale', 'start_date': None, 'type': 'Private Sale', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2020-08-30T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 27500000, 'asset_collected': 'USD', 'price_per_token_in_asset': 0.025, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.025, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 0.025, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 687500, 'is_kyc_required': True, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Uniswap Listing', 'start_date': None, 'type': 'Liquidity Mining', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2020-09-26T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 22500000, 'asset_collected': 'USD', 'price_per_token_in_asset': 0.05, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.05, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 1125000, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 1125000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}]","[{'name': 'Document', 'link': 'https://docs.polkastarter.com/01.-what-is-polkastarter/what-are-the-tokenomics'}]",[],,"[{'category': 'Legal and Accounting', 'amount_in_percentage': 5}, {'category': 'Ecosystem Growth', 'amount_in_percentage': 20}, {'category': 'Liquidity and Exchanges', 'amount_in_percentage': 30}, {'category': 'Product Development', 'amount_in_percentage': 44}]",17874995.0,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': 42.5, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': 10, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': None}",2020-09-23T00:00:00Z,2020-09-23T00:00:00Z,"POLS token distribution is as follows :

BAL is used as a governance token over the network. It intended to provide the rights to make changes such as adding new assets or functionalities, modifying network parameters, or introducing a protocol level fee to allow the token to capture value. However, there is currently no defined structure for how this process will work. 

Liquidity Staking
In August 2020, BAL token holders voted to incentivize liquidity. Since there are 145000 BAL enter circulation each week, 45000 of those tokens are distributed to liquidity providers of key BAL pairs like BAL/ETH,BAL/USDC, BAL/WBTC.

Initially, any asset that had a price on CoinGecko could be accepted. But led to the process being gamed which resulted in a whitelist for assets that are eligible to be deposited in order to earn BAL.

65M will be distributed to liquidity providers where 7.5M BAL enters circulation annually.

The proposed amount of distributed BALs to liquidity providers is 145,000 per week. This means in the first year of BAL’s existence there would be 30% supply inflation off the initially allocated supply of 25M tokens. This high rate of supply inflation is meant to kickstart the distribution of governance rights of the protocol out to those who earn it.

Qredo Network has six types of users. Each type of user is rewarded with a unique combination of fee-based and inflation-based compensation.
Market Makers that continuously provide quotes for a given digital asset.
Validators that take turns validating, proposing and voting on transactions to be included in the next block.
Traders that atomically swap digital assets.
Custody Users that safely custody digital assets.
Liquidity Providers that add liquidity to Qredo’s Loan Pools
Borrowers that take out loans of varying duration.

Fee-based compensation 
Traders and Custody Users pay a fee which is deducted from the Layer 1 assets being transferred, traded or stored. The Qredo protocol then distributes these fees as rewards.

Inflation-based compensation 
The protocol sets a fixed number of tokens to be distributed per epoch to ecosystem participants. This per-epoch approach has a semi-variable inflation rate, which is governed by income or distribution milestones.

Unlike Layer 1 tokens that only reward validators for securing the network, QRDO is tailor-made for a Layer 2 solution and designed to reward all Network participants.",Private Sale,,"[{'title': 'Pre Seed Round', 'start_date': None, 'type': 'Accredited Only', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2018-12-31T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': None, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 2900000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Seed Round', 'start_date': None, 'type': 'Accredited Only', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2019-03-31T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': None, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 11000000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Private Token Sale', 'start_date': None, 'type': 'Accredited Only', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2021-06-28T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': None, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 17500000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Public Token Sale - Option 1', 'start_date': None, 'type': 'Public with allocation', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2021-07-08T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 30000000, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.5, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 15000000, 'is_kyc_required': True, 'restricted_jurisdictions': ['Canada', 'China', 'United States']}, {'title': 'Public Token Sale - Option 2', 'start_date': None, 'type': 'Public with allocation', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2021-07-08T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 10000000, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.225, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 2250000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': ['Canada', 'China', 'United States']}]","[{'name': 'Coinlist FAQs', 'link': 'https://coinlist.co/help/qredo'}]",[],,[],1000000000.0,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': None, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': None, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': None}",2021-09-07T00:00:00Z,,"There is a hard cap of 2 billion on the total supply of QRDO tokens, which will be introduced into circulation via two methods: a vesting schedule and inflationary emissions.

The communication pattern of each round is very similar to the ”normal” case of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance.

In Qredo V1, governance is speared by the core team, taking into account feedback from the community.

Qredo V2
Qredo is working to become a fully decentralised autonomous organisation. In the second half of 2021 Qredo will move into a Federated Model, under its Version 2 Testnet, where a curated set of third party validators will start operating validator nodes. Upon completion of this phase, in early 2022 the number of third party validators will increase towards a fully decentralised model. In Qredo V2, changes to the protocol will be made through token-weighted votes. 

Qredo team run all nodes as of launch, over the next 12 months selected validators will be brought on to the network.  After this phase the validator nodes will be opened up further to meet requirements to decentralise. QRDO holders will be able to stake assets through delegation.",Upcoming,,True,,

In the spirit of the Bitcoin protocol's finite supply of 21 million $BTC, only 21 million $BADGER will ever be issued.

Users earn $BADGER by staking LP positions in wrapped BTC pairs from partner protocols, such as Curve, Sushiswap, and Convex, into staking vaults, called Setts, within the Badger DAO app. Staking rewards include a ""Badger Boost"" - that is, a multiplier on the base yield - based on a formula that calculates a user's dollar value of held $BADGER divided by the dollar value of the non-native staked Sett positions. There are 20 levels of base multipliers on the amount of $BADGER that a user receives; the partner rewards that a staked Sett also earns, such as Curve, Sushi or Convex tokens, do not receive a boost. The Badger DAO also holds promotions for airdrops to users that have donated to specific rounds of Gitcoin grants. $BADGER yields from automated staking strategies alongside the promotional airdrops are the only ways users receive $BADGER.

In March 2021 the Badger DAO voted and approved an external investment from several VC firms - Polychain Capital, Parafi Capital, Blockchain Capital, and Ethereum wallet 0xB1 - directly into the Badger DAO treasury. The investment totalled $21 million and was used for creating an insurance-like USDC backstop within the Badger DAO treasury at a capped amount of 4% of the total $BADGER supply. 

$BADGER holders can also earn $BADGER by staking it directly in the native $BADGER Sett. This Sett provides further incentive for users to hold $BADGER as opposed to directly selling after earning it via non-native Sett vault strategies.","Fair Launch, Airdrop","The initial distribution took place via a fair launch process, which allocated 10% to the team in a time-locked contract with vesting over a 12-month period and 90% to the community that will be distributed via a combination of Badger Setts (i.e., liquidity pool mining), developer rewards, and airdrops.

The BIP can be left open for longer if the content is highly contested or no consensus for path forward is reached. While the BIP is open, the team and community can present arguments to justify its acceptance or rejection. After one week, the Governance Facilitator or Ops Team will determine if consensus has been reached for the content of the BIP. If there are changes necessary, they will synthesize/modify in a comment which will then be pushed forward to snapshot.

It works on the Terra blockchain and is available on Ethereum via the Shuttle bridge.

The MIR token is Mirror Protocol's governance token. Users must deposit MIR into the protocol as a stake to offer and vote on proposals. The protocol rewards MIR stakers with MIR fees paid from CDP withdrawal fees. Mirror LP Token stakers also receive MIR rewards. Incentives paid in MIR are funded by MIR's inflation schedule. The Mirror protocol will issue a maximum of 371 million MIR over four years directly to community participants. 

Minting mAssets requires a proportional deposit of UST stablecoins and another digital asset collateral. The depositor must maintain a minimum 150% value ratio of collateral locked in a CDP and the corresponding mAssets. As the minted mAssets increase in price, the depositor must add a proportionate amount of their collateral tokens. The resulting mAssets have a price that's identical to the underlying asset without owning the underlying. These synthetic assets use a decentralized smart contract, or oracle, to receive a constant data feed of the underlying asset's price. Traders can purchase mAssets on decentralized exchanges like Terraswap and Uniswap.  

Decentralized exchanges require asset pair pools to fulfill trades without matching buyers and sellers. Mirror's mAssets and MIR tokens are available to trade on DEXs against UST stablecoins. Liquidity providers fill the DEX asset pools to receive trading fees from fulfilled orders according to their pool share. Liquidity pool deposits on Terraswap receive LP Tokens to redeem their share of the liquidity pool. Users can stake their LP Tokens on Mirror to earn MIR inflationary rewards as an incentive to provide sufficient liquidity to stabilize mAsset value without centralized market makers.",Airdrop,"Mirror launched the protocol in December 2020 with MIR rewards directly to community participants. The airdrop has been distributed as follows:
UNI Airdrop: 16.66% (9.15 million) tokens airdropped to UNI holders to create liquidity.
LUNA staker airdrop: 16.66% (9.15 million) tokens airdropped to Terraswap LUNA stakers.
Community Pool: 66.66% (36.6 million) tokens allocated to the community pool to fund the protocol's governance and initial development.

No investors or developers received the initial MIR supply. Mirror plans to distribute MIR tokens directly to community participants to launch the protocol with decentralized control.

The MIR inflation schedule is as follows:
mAsset LP Staking: 45.1% (167.27M) tokens are distributed to all mAsset and mAsset (mETH) staking pools by the end of year 4. Tokens are distributed daily to each staking pool (initially 13 pairs for each Mirror and mETH) based on their weight compared to other assets.
Community Pool: 34.6% (128.1M) of total MIR supply will be distributed to the Community Pool by the end of year 4.
MIR LP Staking: 10.4% (38.6M) tokens are evenly distributed to MIR-UST and MIR-UST (mETH) staking pools by the end of year 4. MIR-UST pair has an initial weight of 300%, which is 3 times the initial weight of mAssets. Tokens are distributed on daily basis.
Airdrop (UNI and LUNA staking airdrops): The airdrop amount which was originally distributed to UNI holders and LUNA stakers will account for 4.9% (18.3M) of the total token supply.
LUNA staking reward: 4.9% (18.3M) will be distributed to LUNA stakers throughout the first year since the launching of Mirror Protocol. MIR will be distributed every 100,000 blocks (approximately once every week) to Luna stakers only on the first year, starting from block height 920,000. Snapshot will be taken every 100,000 blocks to determine who is eligible for the staking reward distribution.",Inflationary,"Fixed Supply, Decreasing Inflation Rate",True,370575000.0,"Mirror and MIR operate on the <a href=""https://messari.io/asset/terra/profile"">Terra blockchain</a>, which has integrations with Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. Mirror tokens and mAssets use each network's consensus processes.

Terra Core is based on Tendermint, which relies on a set of validators that are responsible for committing new blocks in the blockchain. These validators participate in the consensus protocol by broadcasting votes which contain cryptographic signatures signed by each validator's private key.

Validator candidates can bond their own LUNA and have LUNA ""delegated"" (or staked) to them by token holders. The Columbus Mainnet can support around 100 validators, but over time this will increase to 300 validators according to a predefined schedule. The validators are determined by who has the most stake delegated to them — the top 100 validator candidates with the most stake will become part of Terra's active validator set.

Validators and their delegators will earn the following fees:
Compute fees: To prevent spamming, validators may set minimum gas fees for transactions to be included in their mempool. At the end of every block, the compute fees are disbursed to participating validators pro-rata to stake.
Stability fees: To stabilize the value of Luna, the protocol charges a small percentage transaction fee ranging from 0.1% to 1% on every Terra transaction, capped at 1 TerraSDR. This is paid in any Terra currency and is disbursed pro-rata to stake at the end of every block in TerraSDR.
Seigniorage rewards: Validators that participate in the Exchange Rate Oracle get a portion of seigniorage if they faithfully report and win the ballot (vote within the reward band around the weighted median).",,,,,,,,,"Governance discussions take place on the governance forum. Participants stake MIR into the Mirror Stake smart contract to propose and vote on improvement measures. The voting portal is available here.

The Mirror Protocol uses a decentralized voting process to manage the protocol. Users must stake MIR in the protocol to vote and receive 1 vote per staked MIR for every poll. Staked MIR tokens utilized in ongoing polls cannot be withdrawn until the poll completes. In addition, the number of MIR used in a proposal cannot be modified after the vote has been submitted.

Polls work as improvement proposals that users can initiate with a 100 MIR deposit and which follow the governance parameters. Any polls that do not pass with the required vote threshold (50%) distribute the proposer's MIR deposit to all stakers according to their share of staked MIR. Polls consist of a text description, links to external resources, and executable code for implementation. In order to be approved, a poll must reach a quorum of 10%. Following a voting period of 201,600 blocks, approved proposals must be executed before the prescribed expiration period (14,400 blocks), or the proposal will be invalidated.

Mirror Governance formats proposals according to six categories: Whitelist a New mAsset, Register Whitelist Parameters, Modify Mint Parameters, Modify Governance Parameters, Spend Community Pool, and Submit Text Proposal. Text Proposals work broadly to make protocol improvements with little or no executable code. The other five categories allow governance participants to specialize by type of improvement. All details about the governance process for each category are available here.",Direct On-Chain Vote,Governance discussions take place off-chain in the Mirror Protocol [governance forum](https://forum.mirror.finance/). Token-weighed voting polls allow MIR stakers to propose and vote on improvement measures. The voting portal is available [here](https://terra.mirror.finance/gov).,True,,

Like Binance, Orion holders benefit from discounts on trading fees by paying in the native asset. By settling trading fees in ORN the user pays 0.2% whilst paying 0.3% otherwise.    

Staking

Based on Orion Protocols Delegated Proof of Broker (DPoB) mechanism, every transaction fee generated through Orion's liquidity aggregator protocol is shared between network participants which are Brokers and non-Brokers.  

Governance mechanism to vote on Brokers

The Brokers are required to stake a sufficient amount of ORN as collateral to be able to fulfil trades on behalf of terminal users, and Non-brokers are able to stake their ORN tokens to vote for their broker of choice based on the share of trading fees offered.   

Governance mechanism to vote on rewards within ORN pools

Users can vote on the amount of rewards from the liquidity mining program that each ORN pool will recieve, by voting the user increases the weight of the pool thus increasing the pool reward rate.    

dApp Marketplace

Users can use ORN to purchase Orion based applications such as arbitrage apps and algorithmic trading bots.   

Orion Solarflare

Orion Solarflare is a decentralised IDO platform, which enables ORN holders access to IDO's by sending  ORN to a dedicated project pool to guarantee the allocation.  

Unlocking advanced features on the terminal

Users who hold ORN will have access to additional premium services such as access to margin trading and advanced trading features.","Private Sale, Initial Dex Offering","At launch, 45% of the total token supply was distributed to the token sale, which includes the DYCO IDO, public sale and seed sale.   

The DYCO sale was conducted on DaoMaker and accounted for 34.1% of the total supply. A DYCO sale offers participants the ability to refund their tokens if the token value falls by more than 20%.  

An additional bonus of 20% (6.9M ORN) was to be allocated to private sale investors, before being burned at the end of 2021 following a governance vote.   

The public sale accounted for 4% of the total supply and was done through an exclusive Elrond staking lottery (3%) where users who had held EGLD for a substantial amount of time on their wallets had increased chances of winning and a ""Gas War"" auction  (1%) where users would bid with ETH gas price to increase their chances of an allocation.   

The seed sale was largely self-funded and conducted internally within the team, this included a 20% bonus. 

The remaining 55 million tokens were distributed privately based on the following allocation of the total supply:  
24%, 24 million ORN: Orion Foundation  
13%, 13 million ORN: Marketing  
12%, 12 million ORN: Team

Orion Protocol has opted for non-inflationary staking rewards meaning no new tokens will be created after the token generation event. Prior to the mainnet staking launch, liquidity mining rewards have been allocated from Orion Protocols marketing budget.

As of June 22nd 2021, Orion Protocol has launched Main Net Pre-Staking with the launch of Orion Pool. Orion Pool consists of Liquidity Providers and Governance Stakers. Liquidity providers earn rewards by providing an equal amount of ORN and a matched asset. They earn swap fees from the AMM pool as well as farming rewards from Orion's Liquidity mining program.

Governance stakers earn rewards by voting with ORN on the pools to increase the reward share provided by the liquidity mining program. In addition to staking rewards, Orion Pool fees (0.3%) will be shared with ⅔ going to Liquidity Providers and ⅓ going to Governance Stakers.

After a higher stable level of daily volume is achieved mainnet staking will go live. Whereby, fees generated by routing trades through Orion Protocol will be shared in the form of staking rewards between the Broker and the Staker as per the Orion's Delegated Proof of Broker (DPoB) mechanism.
Supply Reduction
Orion Protocol has several mechanisms to reduce token supply.

Every ORN committed to participate in the Orion Solarflare IDO's are permanently removed from circulation every quarter. At the end of 2021, this resulted in 468,745 ORN burned from the Victoria VR and Chumbi Valley IDO's.

All licensing fees generated from Orion Protocol's DeFi solutions are used to buy and burn ORN tokens.
Vesting schedules
As of the 31st of December 2021, as per the DYCO framework, only private/public sale funds have been in circulation except for 2.6M ORN from the marketing budget, which is intended for Orion's liquidity mining program.

The tokens from the public sale had no vesting period and were available immediately.

Upon completion of the private sale, 10% of the funds were available immediately the rest was scheduled to be released at 15% monthly for the next 6 months. Followed up by a monthly release of the 20% private sale bonus.

On the 8th of September 2020, the private sale vesting schedule was changed and extended from 6 months to 19 months. The new vesting schedule was as follows:

July 16th 2020: 3.4%, August 16th 2020: 5.1%, October 16th 2020: 3.4%, December 16th 2020: 3.4%, February 16th 2021: 3.4%, April 16th 2021: 3.4%, June 16th 2021: 3.4%, August 16th 2021: 3.4%, October 16th 2021: 3.4%, December 16th 2021: 1.7%.

On August 28th 2021, Orion Protocol had moved to a decentralised vesting smart contract, where tokens would be released by the second, proportional to the number of seconds until the conclusion of the distribution period (December 16th, 2021).

On the 16th of December 2021, Orion Protocol decided to delay both Team and Advisor unlocks for an additional year until the end of 2022.

On December 31, 2021, before the private sale bonus distribution. Orion Protocol users voted to burn the 20% DYCO private sale bonus. This accounted for 6.9 million ORN which is roughly 7% of the total supply.

The seed allocation (3.6M ORN) will release 20% monthly after the 16th of December 2021, along with the 20% seed bonus.

Orion Foundation (24M ORN) will have a linear unlock starting on the 16th of December 2021, with 1M ORN unlocked monthly over the next 24 months.

The remaining Marketing (10.4M ORN) funds will have a linear unlock starting on the 16th of December 2021, with 433k ORN unlocked monthly over the next 24 months.

The Advisor/Partners (6M ORN) and Team (12M ORN) recipients will have a linear unlock schedule starting on the 16th of January 2023, with 1M ORN and 500k respectively being released monthly over the next 12 months.",Fixed Supply,Fixed Supply,True,100000000.0,,Proof-Of-Stake,Delegated Proof of Broker (DPoB),,,,,,,"Orion Protocol is currently working in establishing a governance proposal structure to transtion into a DAO, currently the team monitors various governance proposals through its community channels such as Telegram and Twitter.

The first token burn took place on 12/11/2019 at which point 42,331,625 tokens were burned (this amount included not only fees, but also tokens that were undistributed at the end of the initial exchange offering). 

Subsequent burns: 
Q1 2020 - 986,000
Q2 2020 - 1,411,400
Q3 2020 - 2,105,200
Q4 2020 - 3,165,775

Total tokens burned during this period were 50,000,000 reducing total supply to 950,000,000. 

LCX also initially claimed that all tokens used to pay for fees in the LCX ecosystem would have a guaranteed floor value of $0.10 per token. This aspect of the LCX Token was also revoked in the 'Updated Token Economics' announcement.

GTC was introduced to decentralize Gitcoin's platform through GitcoinDAO.  GTC holders can participate in key decision-making such as fund allocation, matching pools, grant collusion, and determining governance framework for delegates. The Founder of Gitcoin has claimed that more formal frameworks for developing and maintaining Gitcoin will be introduced over time and handled by on-chain voting.  

At the base layer, GTC is a standard ERC-20 token that has adopted the governance style of COMP/UNI. The token has an additional delegation prompt feature built into the retroactive claim process, allowing claimers to delegate tokens to themselves or one of the Gitcoin Stewards to achieve a higher voter turnout rate. Past participants can now claim their retroactive airdrops via the Quadratic Lands using any Ethereum compatible wallets.","Airdrop, Private Sale","The total supply of GTC is 100 million tokens. 50% of the token supply was allocated to members that have contributed to the ecosystem in the past, and 50% will be allocated to future participants under the DAO supervision.

From launch until May 2023, there will be a monthly increase of 2,083,333 liquid GTC supply due to the monthly vesting (2-years duration) to the Gitcoin DAO treasury. During the same period, there will be a monthly increase of 1,400,000 liquid GTC supply contributed by the monthly vesting (2-years duration) to existing stakeholders. However, as the funds will be non-transferrable for at least 500 days, the supply curve shows a cliff with a height of 25,200,000 GTC (18 months of vested tokens) in October 2022 and will continue to increase monthly by 1,400,000 GTC until May 2023.

Retroactive Airdrop (15%)

Past participants can claim retroactive airdrops with no vesting schedule.

Existing Stakeholders (35%)

Existing stakeholders are members who have contributed to the growth of Gitcoin since 2017, including the team, investors, future employees, and strategic partners. This allocation of GTC will be subjected to a two-year vesting schedule and non-transferrable for at least 500 days.

Community Treasury (50%)

The last 50% of the total GTC supply has been deposited into the Gitcoin DAO treasury, governed by on-chain voting. The allocated GTC will vest monthly over two years, ending by May 25th, 2023.",Fixed Supply,,True,100000000.0,,Other,,,,,,False,,"All meaningful governance discussion is conducted on the governance forum. Gitcoin has three governance roles, including stewards, delegators, and contributors. Anyone can become a steward, but the community(delegators) will delegate voting power based on their preferences. Contributors are individuals who help carry out the community’s will by working on successfully endorsed workstreams.

Stewards and contributors define workstreams in Gitcoin’s governance. Workstreams are topics that DAO governance should revolve around. Anyone can start a new workstream and build up supporters by posting on the forum. However, the workstreams proposed must 
have a clear objective and reason of how the proposed workstream aligns with Gitcoin’s mission
have an accountable steward responsible for achieving the goal
be mutually exclusive from the existing workstreams
have a clear budget and a clear timeline of activities
The Gitcoin Governance Forum provides a place for discussion and collaboration on topics related to specific workstreams. Once the community deems that the case is ready is be formalized, members will publish formal proposals in the Proposal Discussion section. A forum proposal will not be qualified for Snapshot voting later unless it

has received upvotes from at least five stewards
has been live for at least five days
follows GCP template for a general proposal
follows the workstream template if this is a proposal to form a new workstream

Once the proposal has achieved the required threshold, formal off-chain voting can take place on Snapshot. Snapshot is an interface that allows stewards to vote on proposals. The number of GTC assigned to the voting address is weighted to determine the voting result. As of now, Gitcoin will use the Snapshot voting for final governance decision-making. Currently, Gitcoin is in the process of fine-tuning and implementing an on-chain voting mechanism. In the future, any proposals that will require transferring GTC from the DAO or making changes to the Gitcoin structure will be voted on Tally.

The voting on Tally and Snapshot will exhibit the same mechanism. The voting power will be proportional to the number of GTC delegated. As Gitcoin utilizes a fork of Compound’s governance framework, all proposals demand a 1% minimum proposal threshold, a 2.5% quorum, and a 51% majority to pass. This means that the proposer must have at least 1% of GTC supply delegated to them, 2.5% of GTC supply holders must turn up to the vote, and 51% of the vote must be in favor for the proposal to pass.","Third-Party Protocol, Delegated On-Chain Vote","As of now, Gitcoin will use the Snapshot voting for final governance decision-making.

There is a bridge between the LTO Network and Ethereum which makes it possible to transfer mainnet LTO to their ERC-20 equivalents. These are the same LTO tokens but simply exist on different blockchains (1:1) . The total supply is simply being split into two different sides.

Since then, the bridge troll takes 10 LTO as a swap fee whichever side you switch from.",Fixed Supply,Fixed Supply,True,500000000.0,"In LTO Network's Leased Proof-of-Stake variation, nodes selected to validate transactions and forge the next block based on the number of tokens held and staked on the network. Unlike other Leased PoS systems, LTO Network applies a ""raffle factor"" to the algorithm that selects the node to forge the next ""key"" block. This model is, in theory, more fair than previous Leased PoS systems because it doesn't overvalue a node with a higher amount of staked tokens.

LTO also leverages the NG-protocol. NG allows the network to generate two different block types: a key block and a micro block. When the network selects a node to forge a block, the node creates a key block from all outstanding micro blocks. New key blocks arrive every 30-90 seconds, while micro blocks take form every 1.1 seconds.",Proof-of-Stake,Fair Leased Proof-of-Stake,30.0,,n/a,,,,,,,,,

Governance is the most notable utility, as it will allot those who stake the Alpaca token, xAlpaca tokens, which are then in turn used as votes to dictate the direction of the protocol through key governance decisions. Protocol fees and how they are distributed to stakers will be dictated by those voting through this governance, and fees will be accumulated not only through platform revenue such as yield-farming performance fees (3%), liquidation bounties (4-5%), and lending interest (10-19%), but also through token burns. Tokens are burned with the objective of fee distribution, as well as increasing token price over longer periods of time.

Alpaca is designed to be deflationary in the long run as a result of these burns. Emissions are hard-capped and gradually decrease, however, token burns will continue regardless. Liquidation fees and lending interest also contribute to these burns, using a buyback and subsequent burn method. This means that the more Alpaca's platform is utilized, the more tokens are burnt, and the more deflationary supply becomes by default.

Additionally, there are opportunities within the platform that can only be claimed by holding the Alpaca token. This includes exclusive farming opportunities through partnerships with other protocols only made available in the Grazing Range section of the platform. Alpaca is looking to integrate NFTs into the utility of the platform. Only token holders will be able to see benefit from this utility, access these NFTs, as well as receive real-world Alpaca merchandise.",Fair Launch,"ALPACA was a fair launch project that did not have pre-existing investors, no pre-sale, and no pre-mine.

If the liquidation is initiated by the protocol's internal bot, the burn from the liquidation bounty is 5% rather than 4.

These investors combined to purchase 7.5% of the initial HNS supply of 1.36 billion tokens, valuing the Handshake network at $136 million.

Of the remaining HNS supply, Handshake reserved 7.5% each for early contributors (to pay for pre-launch development), Certificate Authorities (CAs) or naming corporations, and domain name holders with authentic proof of ownership. Another 5% of tokens went to various non-profits and FOSS projects, who also received all of Handshake's  $10.2 million fundraise as donations.

Finally, the project pledged to give the majority of the initial supply (65%) to Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) developers and projects, as well as non-profit organizations and universities. Developers with a valid GitHub account were able to claim these coins via an HNS faucet, a software tool that allows users to generate free tokens.

Handshake provided a 90-day period before its mainnet launch (called a ""Sunrise Period"") for all existing rights-holders (name and TLD owners) to claim their ""trademarked names"" and HNS allocations. Any unclaimed tokens would eventually get burned.","[{'title': 'Token Sale', 'start_date': '2018-08-02T04:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private', 'details': 'Handshake raised $10.2 million from a group of venture funds and individuals, including a16z, Founders Fund, Polychain Capital, and Draper Associates.

Post-launch, the network will operate via a burn-and-mint mechanism, where miners mint new coins as part of Handshake's <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work"">Proof-of-Work</a> (PoW) consensus and users burn coins as they register domain names. The number of burned coins will be challenging to predict, as it will depend entirely on the blockchain's usage. Concerning issuance, miners will mint a total of 680 million new tokens at a rate of 2,000 tokens per block, and this reward will undergo a halving every 3.25 years.",Burn & Mint,Other Burn & Mint models,True,2040000000.0,"Consensus
Handshake uses <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work"">Proof-of-Work</a> (PoW) consensus to reach a global agreement on the ordering of HNS transactions and when a user registers a domain name. Its nodes each run the same software rules so every participant can reach an agreement on name ownership.

Handshake's consensus rules resemble that of <a href=""https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin/profile"">Bitcoin</a>, whereby the valid chain is the longest chain with the most accumulated work (i.e., hash power). Like Bitcoin, network consensus is probabilistic because a new competing chain, known as a fork, could emerge with more accumulated work and invalidate the current chain. Handshake opted for PoW over alternative consensus mechanisms because of its known security parameters and its ability to support compact light client proofs. Its blockchain leverages the latter feature by allowing users to participate in consensus and resolve names via Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes (i.e., light clients) instead of full nodes.

Mining
Handshake miners generate new blocks using the BLAKE2b + SHA3 hash algorithm, and hashes in Handshake are Big-Endian. Because Handshake is SegWit-only, there are no output scripts, just addresses (which themselves are witness program version + witness program hash). A witness program can encode a public key or a script hash, but those keys and scripts will appear in transaction inputs as witness stack items.

As for the mining process, miners compete to produce a block header less than the target set by Handshake's difficulty level. Handshake adjusts the difficulty level, or how hard it is to discover a valid block header, every block to keep block times around ten minutes. The network borrows from Zcash's difficulty retargeting algorithm, which uses a variation of DigiShield. Handshake opted for a reimplementation of DigiShield because it performs well when faced with abrupt changes in network hash rate.",Proof-of-Work,,600.0,2000.0,cBlake,2023-05-04T04:00:00Z,,,"The Handshake intends to have a similar governance system to <a href=""https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin/profile"">Bitcoin</a>, whereby anyone in the Handshake open source community can submit improvement proposals advocating for a specific code change. By Bitcoin's standards, the community would openly debate any new proposal before deciding on whether to merge the software changes into the Handshake's client codebase. Once accepted and implemented, node operators must be persuaded to adopt the new changes.

Once launched, the District Registry will replace the pseudo-on-chain voting system currently for district creation with a community-driven token curated registry (TCR). The registry will allow for on-chain governance within each district as well as governance over the district0x network at large.

An interim step before full on-chain governance implementation will be the district0x Tasp App. The Task App will list all tasks fundamental to the district0x roadmap including everything from design work, to marketing, to development, and allow for 3rd party service providers to bid on these individual tasks.",Direct On-Chain Vote,"The district0x project is pursuing a full on-chain governance system. This goal will be reached when all governance decisions for the project are entirely handed over to the community, which represents the final milestone of the project. The District Registry is a critical component of this movement, transitioning governance from what was a pseudo-on-chain voting mechanism for district creation, to an entirely on-chain, community-driven token curated registry (TCR).

__District Registry voting__
Once live, anyone can create a district and apply it to the District Registry, which will be a whitelist of projects approved to access the network. In order to apply for inclusion, districts will be required to submit a proposal for their district and send district0x network tokens (DNT) to the registry smart contract as a deposit. If an application goes unchallenged, meaning there are no objections to inclusion, the district will be created and an Aragon entity will be established. The original deposit will be sent to this entity to establish voting rights for the district.

__District Registry challenges__
If the district is challenged, a vote will occur during which time token holders can vote whether or not to include the new entity. In order to challenge an application, a token holder would be required to stake DNT equal to the amount deposited by the applicant. If voters decide not to include a new district, the applicant forfeits their tokens, which will be distributed to the voters that voted for the winning side (e.g. the side that voted not to include). If a challenge fails, and the district is accepted, the challenger will forfeit their deposit.",,,

Hence, the team token vesting shown in the supply curve is an estimate provided by the project. 98.5% of the allocation for investors are subject to a one-year linear unlocking schedule and the remaining 1.5% tokens would be vested according to a two-year schedule. Finally, 200,000 DDX tokens reserved for the advisors were unlocked on a three-month schedule and the outstanding 460,000 tokens were subject to a two-year vesting scheme.

Liquidity Mining Supply

The liquidity mining phase would see 50 million of the maximum DDX supply emitted over 10 years. DerivaDEX built its insurance fund through an insurance mining program. This is a year-long staking program where stablecoins is staked to receive rewards in DDX. The insurance mining program runs for 2.1 million blocks (about a year) and a reward of 1.2 DDX was rewarded per block. In total, 2.5 million DDX was emitted over one year as part of the insurance program. The outstanding 47.5 million DDX will be emitted over 10 years, with the rate of supply subject to the governance of the DerivaDAO.",Inflationary,FIxed Issuance,True,100000000.0,,,,,,,,,,"The DerivaDAO is responsible for the operation, maintenance, modification, and growth of the decentralized exchange. To signify this adherence to autonomy, the team has declared that the exchange can only proceed to mainnet phase if the mainnet release proposal is voted in favour of by the DAO.

Proposals that relate to the modification of the exchange are either logic upgrade proposals or state changes. Logic upgrades typically involve substantial modifications, for example, adding exchange contracts to the protocol. On the other hand, state changes are narrower in scope and level of modification. A proposal that suggests the listing of a new trading pair or an increase of trading fees would fall under state change proposals.

DerivaDAO's governance process starts off-chain in the governance forum. Within the forum, community members freely ideate and develop progressive ways to support the protocol. Also, the rest of the community get to critique, offer improvements, understand and show general sentiments towards proposals before they are submitted on-chain.",Direct On-Chain Vote,"Governance proposals are finalized through on-chain votes by eligible community members who hold the DDX token. The on-chain voting process consists of three phases:   

__Proposal Submission__

Here, proposals that have successfully passed through the off-chain draft stage is submitted to be voted upon on-chain. Only addresses that hold at least 1% of the DDX circulating supply can submit a proposal. This criterion was designed to cut down on spam and malicious proposals. To further drive autonomy, it is possible for token holders to delegate their DDX to users who they believe share the same progressive views and plans for the protocol.

__Voting__

All token holders are eligible to vote on proposals. A proposal submitted on-chain would typically pass through a three-day voting period. This voting period may be shorter than three days if more than half of the DDX circulating supply has voted in favour of or against the proposal, after which the proposal is immediately succeeded or failed. Successful proposals have a minimum requirement of 4% of the circulating supply.

__Queuing and Execution__

After a proposal has been successfully voted in favour of, the proposal is queued for three days before implementation occurs.",,,

The project does not currently practice any scheduled or regular token burns, but with the governance decision to cap the supply of FARM to 690,420 the project also decided to burn 14,850.108 FARM tokens.

An outcome of the October 2020 exploit was the creation of the GRAIN token. The token is essentially an IOU for affected users of the protocol to be made whole. The GRAIN token is issued at a 1:1 ratio corresponding to the amount lost in the exploit. GRAIN token holders are entitled to 0.5% of the weekly FARM emissions. Holders of GRAIN can swap their GRAIN for FARM in a designated Uniswap pool, or if a user holds both tokens they can earn further rewards by providing liquidity to the pool.",Fixed Supply,Decreasing Issuance,True,690420.0,,n/a,,,,,,,,"Initial protocol governance proposals are generally discussed in the Harvest Finance #governance channel. This is an informal process which allows any interested parties to facilitate discussions regarding protocol changes. Once a proposal gains enough traction within the community, a proposal may be created on the projects snapshot where FARM holders can submit their votes.  

The core development team for Harvest Finance maintains the ability to make day-to-day changes and ultimately controls whether protocol changes are implemented. Proposals which are voted on in snapshot are generally higher-level is nature, whereas implementing new vault strategies or deploying new vaults are left up to the core development to implement.",No-On Chain Governance,Harvest Finance does not currently have an on-chain governance mechanism. Any proposals are created on snapshot and voted on in that forum; the only validation utilized by snapshot is to ensure voters hold some FARM in their wallet. The core development team ultimately controls which changes are implemented into the protocol.,,,

Stakers of the QUICK token are able to receive protocol fees from transactions made in the exchange. The protocol currently charges a 0.3% fee on all swaps, from which 0.25% is redirected to liquidity providers 0.04% to single-asset QUICK stakers, and 0.01% to the QuickSwap Foundation.   

The second use for the QUICK token is for governance. Currently QuickSwap performs governance off-chain via Snapshot, where token holders are able to vote on changes to be made to the protocol by connecting their wallets to Snapshot and casting their votes.",Liquidity Mining,"The distribution of QUICK is as follows:  
90% of QUICK is allocated to liquidity providers over a 4-year period 
5% will be airdropped to UNI holders 
3.25% is reserved for team and advisors  
1% will be airdropped in the future 
0.75% is reserved for marketing  

The QuickSwap team and community may also submit a vote in the near future to form a community treasury to fund the development of the project.  

Distribution of tokens consisted of a fair launch in which 96.75% of the total supply was reserved for the community. 90% of the tokens are being distributed to the community via liquidity mining over a four year period which started upon launch. The rate at which the tokens are distributed is a function of the TVL at any given moment. This means that it is difficult to generate a reliable supply curve to track the distribution.

Purchasers were verified based on know-your-customer (KYC) principles. Tokens were priced at $0.12 per BLZ token with the hard cap reached, within 24 hours. A total of 500 million BLZ tokens were created with 165 million sold through the private and public sale, representing 33% of the total supply. These tokens were subject to a thirty-day lockup and were released only to whitelisted addresses. 

A remaining, 75 million tokens, 15% of the total supply, were reserved for founders. These will vest monthly over four years with a six-month cliff. Additionally, 25 million, 5% of the total supply, was allocated to initial seed investor TGV that has the same vesting as all employee tokens. A total of 50 million tokens were reserved for advisors and bounties that will vest between twelve and twenty-four months. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), was formally engaged to ensure that all funds received from their token sale were being accounted for and used in the appropriate manner. 

Prior to Bluzelle’s token offering, the company had received funding from two equity rounds totaling $1.8 million. The first of these was for $300,000 from True Global Ventures (TGV) in March 2016. Nearly fifteen months later the project raised another $1.5 million to explore the possibility of a decentralized database service. Investors in this round received only equity, while TGV received an allocation of the token offering. ",,,,,,n/a,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,,

There are three ways to get vBOND:
1. Users can lock staked BOND for a period of up to 1 year, receiving up to 2x in bonus voting power. This bonus decays linearly back to 1x over the course of the lock period.
2. Users can simply stake BOND tokens without locking them and without obtaining any bonus vBOND.
3. Users can delegate vBOND to other users, up to one delegatee per address. There can be only one delegatee at a time. Only the actual balance can be delegated, not any bonus vBOND, nor can this delegated balance cannot be locked.
To create a proposal, a user needs to own 1% of the BOND staked in “Barn” (i.e., the DAO Staking Smart Contract). A proposal creator can only have one active proposal at a time but can vote on other proposals. You can find a proposal template[ here](https://medium.com/barnbridge/barnbridge-dao-built-for-the-future-3735fbd671c5). Every proposal can include up to a maximum number of 10 actions that can be executed on-chain (e.g., smart contract deployments, treasury allocations). For four days following the initial proposal, the proposal exists in a Warm-Up state, providing users the time to stake additional BOND prior to the voting period. If the creator’s balance falls below the 1% threshold the proposal is cancelled automatically.

After this initial period, any staked BOND holder can vote. Votes can only be pro or against, and users can cancel and change their votes for the duration of the voting period (also four days).
For a vote to pass, 40% of staked BOND must participate in the vote, and a minimum acceptance of 60% must be met.

Once a proposal is accepted, it will have to wait in a queue before it can be executed. During this time, it still can be canceled or changed via a cancellation proposal. Once a proposal becomes executable, any users can call the execute function. If the proposal is not executed during the Grace period, it is marked as expired and cannot be executed anymore.",True,,

First was a private sale to institutional and accredited investors and followed by a pre-sale to the public. The project initially scheduled a main public token sale, but canceled it in late 2017 citing volatile markets and enough funding from the previous sales. A total of 466.0 million tokens were created.

Of the 466 million tokens minted, Aion Foundation and Founding Partners were each allocated 20% (93 million AION), while 51.5% (240 million AION; most of which came from tokens earmarked for cancelled public sale) were allocated for redistribution to token holders as a part of the Token Release Schedule (TRS), which was designed to incentivize long-term commitment from public token holders and the Aion Foundation/Founding Partners. The intent prior to the cancelation of the public sale was for any leftover tokens from all sale rounds to be allocated to the TRS redistribution pool.

The public TRS was allocated 120 million tokens, which in addition to the amount contributed to the TRS (37 million AION), are being released to token holders who chose to contribute over 12 months, 31.25% of which was distributed in the first month (49 million AION), with a continued release of 6.25% (9.8 million AION) over the remaining 11 months, ending November 15, 2018.

The private TRS was allocated 120 million tokens, which in addition to the amount contributed to the TRS (186 million AION), are being released to the Aion Foundation and Founding Partners evenly over 36 months at a rate of 2.8% per month (8.6 million AION), ending November 15, 2020.","[{'title': 'Token Sale (USD)', 'start_date': '2017-09-01T16:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2017-09-25T16:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 5596776, 'asset_collected': 'USD', 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.5, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 2798388, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Token Sale (ETH)', 'start_date': '2017-09-01T16:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2017-09-25T16:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 19969005.84795, 'asset_collected': 'ETH', 'price_per_token_in_asset': 0.00171, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.5, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 34147, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 9984502.92, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Token Sale (BTC)', 'start_date': '2017-09-01T16:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2017-09-25T16:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 5683333.3333, 'asset_collected': 'BTC', 'price_per_token_in_asset': 0.00012, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.5, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 682, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 2841666.67, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Pre-Sale', 'start_date': '2017-10-03T16:00:00Z', 'type': 'Public', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2017-10-10T16:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 10000000, 'asset_collected': 'ETH', 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.88, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 24220, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 8800000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}]","[{'name': 'White Paper', 'link': 'https://aion.network/media/en-aion-network-technical-introduction.pdf'}]",[],,"[{'category': 'Compensation', 'amount_in_percentage': 55}, {'category': 'Marketing & Ecosystem', 'amount_in_percentage': 10}, {'category': 'Professional Services', 'amount_in_percentage': 15}, {'category': 'G&A', 'amount_in_percentage': 20}]",465934587.0,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': 11.7, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': 71.5, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': None}",,2018-04-24T08:00:00Z,"In Nov. 2018, The OAN shifted the economics of AION issuance due to the introduction of Unity, the network's new consensus protocol that combines elements of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS).

As a result, annual AION issuance should be around 14,191,200, which is now evenly split between stakers and miners.

The DAO-Whale role is open to members who lock up 1000 $WHALE, which gives them the right to post a proposal twice per month, in addition to being able to vote in the SENATE. 
The DAO-Voter role allows members who lock up 500 $WHALE, access to voting in the SENATE but they are not able to submit proposals.  

A typical process for a proposal to move from the initiation to implementation stage in the WHALE DAO includes: 
Idea: The general community is encouraged to contribute ideas that will move the project forward. 
Discussion: Once an idea is suggested, the whole WHALE community is invited to give their input. If the idea picks enough interest, it advances to the proposal stage. 
Proposal: Only a DAO-Whale has the right to move an agreed proposal to the House. 
House: The House is open to members who have claimed the Hold-to-Play roles by holding the required amounts of $WHALE in their self-custodial wallet. Members of the house will vote on the proposal before it is submitted to the Senate. 
Senate: DAO-Whales and DAO-Voters are eligible to vote at this stage to determine the final fate of the proposal. Once final checks and approval are made by the Advisory Board, the proposal is considered for implementation by the WHALE Team.",,,,,

DODO: Token holders can use DODO for the following:
Governance rights: holders can create and vote on proposals where 1 DODO = 1 vote

vDODO: vDODO is a token that serves as a user’s proof of membership in DODO’s loyalty program. Holders can use vDODO for the following:
Governance rights: holders can create and vote on proposals where1 vDODO = 100 votes
Crowdpooling and IDO allocations
Trading fee discounts

vDODO membership rewards (exclusive to vDODO token holders): DODO reward tokens will be distributed to vDODO holders every block (6 DODO reward tokens are released and distributed to vDODO holders every block, and vDODO holders receive DODO reward tokens proportional to their shares of vDODO)

vDODO token can be minted by staking 100 DODO tokens, and are not transferable. In order to redeem vDODO back to DODO tokens, token holders would need to pay an 'exit fee' in vDODO tokens, which would be immediately distributed to all remaining vDODO holders. The 'exit' fee is dynamically adjusted to the proportion of vDODO in circulation to DODO in circulation.","Private Sale, Initial Exchange Offering","DODO has closed three rounds of funding from investors:
Seed Round: $600,000 (6% of total supply, or 60 million DODO tokens at $0.01) raised at a $10,000,000 valuation. The vesting schedule for seed investors is identical to Core Team/Future Hires/Advisors, i.e. the tokens will be locked up for one year and released linearly over the next two years. The round was held on Aug. 28, 2020, and led by Framework Ventures and DeFiance Capital
Private Sale Round: $5,000,000 (10% of total supply, or 100 million DODO tokens at $0.05 per token) was raised at a $50,000,000 valuation. The private sale allocation was subject to a six-month lockup period. After the six-month lockup, 10% of the private sale allocation will be released immediately, and the remaining 90% will be released linearly over one year. The private sale was held before DODO IDO but only disclosed on DODO's Twitter page on Oct. 13, 2020. The round was led by Pantera Capital, Three Arrows Capital, Binance Labs, and joined by Coinbase Ventures and DeFiance Capital. 
Initial DODO Offering (IDO): For listing, DODO token was put in circulation on the DODO Exchange itself, leveraging proactive market maker (PMM) algorithm’s price discovery mechanism via IDO.

It is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum main net and constitutes a work, payment and governance token.  

Work and Staking 
HOPR relay node operators stake HOPR tokens in dedicated HOPR payment channels in order to be eligible for sending data packets or relaying other users’ data packets. Node operators open payment channels to downstream nodes and are then able to relay packets through that node. A relay node operator is thereby incentivized to open many payment channels in order to maximize their likelihood of relaying traffic. At the same time, staking HOPR tokens requires locking up capital and thus incentivizes node operators to maintain payment channels with active and well-behaving nodes. In addition, to signal availability as a relay node operator, staking HOPR tokens in payment channels entitles the node to relay cover traffic and earn HOPR tokens for doing so.

Payment 
HOPR tokens are used by senders of a packet (data) to pay relay node operators. For each packet that is successfully relayed to the next downstream node, the downstream node reveals a key to the upstream relayer and thus provides a proof-of-relay for that upstream node. With this key, the relayer earns the chance for a payout. This probabilistic micropayment mechanism is similar to obtaining a lottery ticket that - in case of a win - can be redeemed on-chain for HOPR tokens, claimed out of the corresponding payment channel. The expectation value per packet is thus the product of the payout amount (in HOPR tokens) times the odds. Both values (payout and odds) will be fixed prior to the deployment of the HOPR mainnet but will be updated by token vote after year one.  

Governance and Quadratic Voting 
Since the token has yet to launch, the HOPR team acknowledges that many token economic mechanisms and parameters are unknown at present. As such, the HOPR token will be used to vote on such mechanisms and parameters, starting one year of operating the network. Beyond governance of parameters on token mechanics and economics, the HOPR token is used to govern the HOPR association. Thus, the HOPR association constitutes a DAO with on-chain governance of a legal embodiment of the DAO in the real world. Voting rights in the association are given to individuals or organizations that can demonstrate ownership of tokens and are approved as members of the association by the board. The voting power of each party is proportional to the square root of tokens that are held by a party at the cutoff time for the vote or general assembly. Voting power proportional to the square root of the number of tokens is the basis of quadratic voting (QV). QV is a new democratic voting scheme that has found early applications in the Colorado state legislature as well as blockchain projects such as Gitcoin.","Crowdsale, Private Sale",,"[{'title': 'Private Presale', 'start_date': '2020-03-01T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2020-12-01T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': None, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 2200000, 'is_kyc_required': True, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}]",,[],,[],130208333.0,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': 16.5, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': 44, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': None}",2021-02-02T00:00:00Z,,"The distribution of tokens are as follows:

The governance functions of CVP include:
Governing the PowerIndex and thus the underlying protocols in the index
Upgrading and maintaining the source code of the smart contracts and key protocol variables.
Adding/removing governance tokens.
Incentivize and empower other activities to users such as liquidity mining to foster the protocol

Additionally, each product in the PowerPool universe also brings value to the CVP.
PowerIndex brings value to CVP by accruing fees from the pool and distributing it to the CVP holders and voters. Thus, CVP became a cash flow-based token, but only in case of active participation in the governance process. Also since CVP must be a set portion of the PowerIndex, its value is determined by the total value locked in the index.
PowerOracle brings value to CVP by acting as a work token. This is achieved by users staking CVP and running a node. Moreover, the user gets rewarded if the nodes perform a correct operation, and could get the risk of slashing if the nodes perform dishonest work.
Lending and borrowing of governance tokens also bring value to CVP since the more passive token holders pooled their tokens in the platform, the more power CVP holders can have in governing other protocols.",Fair Launch,"The team behind PowerPool allocated all of the CVP supply to testnet and mainnet liquidity mining participants. The testnet distributions consisted of Alpha, Beta, and Gamma rounds that allowed liquidity miners to obtain 15% of the total 100 million supply. The remaining supply will become available to liquidity miners and Uniswap and Balancer LPs (liquidity providers) at the project's mainnet launch.
Alpha Round: 5% or 5 million tokens
Beta Round: 5% or 5 million tokens with 6-month lock and 18-month linear vest
Gamma Round: 5% or 5 million tokens with 6-month lock and 18-month linear vest
Liquidity Mining Rewards - 24% or 24 million CVP for the 1st year with 1-year lock from date paid.
The remaining CVP added to the Community Treasury(51M) - so that CVP holders can govern whether or not to use for future liquidity mining programs, other incentives or to burn.",[],,[],,[],100000000.0,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': None, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': None, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': None}",,,,Fixed Supply,Fixed Supply,True,100000000.0,,,,,,,,,,"CVP token holders can submit and vote on proposals to govern the system. The protocol also provides voting functions to all LP tokens, which are related to CVP. For example, CVP-ETH LP token from Uniswap, and PIPT as well. Additionally, the interesting part of PowerPool governance design is it allows community members to create real political parties: people like to vote in groups, share opinions with each other, and make decisions together. This makes political parties an essential part of PowerPool’s meta-governance layer.

Governance starts with discussions initiated by the Protocol Politicians or people who have trust and reputation in a particular protocol. After the Protocol Politician proposes their proposition, Major Holders evaluate the proposal and if majorities are satisfied the voting will be valid. In order for the proposal to be valid, it needs a quorum of 400,000 CVP.",Upcoming,"Currently, there are 2 ways users can vote.

TRB tokens are used for data requesters (dApps in DeFi) to pay for data requests, to reward data providers for fulfilling data requests, to initiate and vote on disputes. 

Tellor has four key types of network participants: data requesters, miners (now called data providers), disputers, and voters.  

Rewards in TRB incentivize reporters to submit data using both peer-to-peer payments and inflationary rewards.  When data reporters submit data on the blockchain, they are paid with TRB tokens as a reward.

Using TRB, parties can “tip” a specific question or “query” they want updated, then reporters can choose whether the reward for fetching the data is worth the cost of placing the value on-chain. TRB is also used to resolve disputes about the validity of data. Both opponents and supporters will vote on the validity of the data. 

The reporter must send 100 TRB to the Tellor network to participate in the reporting process. The reporters risk losing this stake if they submit data that is successfully disputed. The security of Tellor comes through a deposit of TRB that acts as a bond or stake requirement in order for reporters to participate in providing data. ",Fair Launch,"There was no pre-mine or ICO, it was initially set up as solely a 10% dev. share model where development team received 10% of the mined base reward as a fee to fund the ongoing development of Tellor.  

In order to initialize the Tellor oracle network at mainnet launch, the team had to have a minimum of 6 staked miners to run. At that time, the team used a median of the data provided by 5 miner addresses (and 6th as a backup in case someone was disputed).  

Hence, the launch was done with a total of 6000 TRB minted by the team and sent to 6 different wallets to kickstart mining TRB.  The bond for being a miner (providing oracle data) was initially set at 1000 tokens. 

Tokens were sold on as needed basis by Tellor to provide liquidity to users of the oracle. The grant money from Consensys and Binance helped to fund full time development on the Tellor oracle before TRB was listed on any exchanges, and none of those funds remain.

The developers wanted to account for flexibility of supply in the cases of multiple chains and large exogenous shocks to demand (such as for speculation, or else).   

Hence, Tellor X introduced a new structure of flexibly supply growth rates for mining networks wherein each chain on which Tellor is deployed has its unique inflationary reward system, as well as Tellor Treasuries (staking pools) to reduce the circulating supply and increase governance participation.  The initial minting rate for Tellor Treasuries rewards is 10% annualized released every 90 days, starting Jan 21, 2022.

  Since the Tellor X update in Dec 2020, Tellor moved from PoW to PoS, so rewards to miners (now called reporters) are no longer done via mining blocks. Under this new model, Inflationary mining rewards on Ethereum were set via an initial vote to fund the oracle contract with 24,000 new TRB for a 2 year period with 1000 tokens released per month, after which a new governance vote can be done to fund the Ethereum mining contract.   This flexibility allows for other chains to also be funded with inflationary rewards. 

The overall supply growth rate will need to be managed however, but the more flexible nature of the monetary policy affords an initial lower rate of inflation with the ability to mint more.

  The old Tellor (August 2019 - Dec 2020) supply was growing at the rate of the base reward (1 TRB per 10 minutes) X 144 queries max per day, across 5 miners would receive a total of 22 TRB, for net new issuance of 3168 TRB per day.   

There is a Grants Program that involves votes to mint new tokens to new users and promising projects.    

With the Tellor X Dec 2020 update, a new Dev share was minted with a 100,000 token allocation, with 4,000 new tokens released monthly. This replaces the old 10% dev share of the base reward structure due to the transition away from PoW.  

As Tellor moves toward a DAO structure, future employees of the Tellor system, including the current team, will need to apply for future minting events if they want to continue being rewarded for their contributions.",Inflationary,"Dynamic Emission, Increasing Issuance",,,,Proof-Of-Stake,,,,,,,,"Off-chain governance discussions are currently done on the Teller discord. So far all governance proposals have been initiated by the core team or community devs working closely with them, but there is a process by which any TRB holder can initiate a governance proposal.   

Tellor has had plans to move towards a DAO structure long term and the idea of the core Tellor team will cease to exist. Future employees of Tellor will need to apply for future minting events if they want to continue being rewarded for their contributions.   

Tellor Improvement Proposals (TIP) were introduced in Oct 2020 to be used for proposal and voting by the community of token holders to make changes to the Tellor oracle via governance.  

TIPs describe any proposed improvements, fork proposals, and pre-specified data requests for the community to vote on and discuss. For TIPs in general, ideas are first discussed in the Discord prior to opening a pull request in the GitHub issues of the repository.   

Off-chain TIPs can involve general improvements to any Tellor process including the process of conducting the TIPs themselves.",Delegated On-Chain Vote,"Tellor on-chain governance is used to settle disputes, to vote on upgrades, and for implementing new features such as monetary policy. TRB holders, data reporters, and users (data requesters) are the stakeholders in the governance process.

Votes for these parties are weighted to provide checks and balances. TRB holder weights are measured as the balance of TRB on the chain where the vote is taking place. For reporters, each submitted data point provides them additional non-transferable voting power weighted at 1 TRB per successful submission. 

Reporters must be actively bonded to be able to vote with their allocated non-transferable voting power. Tellor can be deployed on any chain, however the main token is staying on Ethereum, and the governance process on other chains will need to be handled with a different configuration.   

The governance on a specific chain would be controlled by the stakeholders on that chain (e.g. Polygon could use a mix of Polygon data reporters, Polygon Tellor users, and MATIC token holders). Voting rights can also be delegated by holders, reporters, and users to allow smaller, more inactive holders to give their vote to a trusted third party.   

Proposals are submitted for a vote by paying a fee. Parties then vote on the proposal for one week (the voting period). After the voting period, on-chain updates and votes will be automatically implemented or rejected.  

Proposals to the miner code base or any other off-chain improvements will be implemented if passed. If there is a dispute, these votes may undergo multiple rounds. Certain functions can require various quorums or vote lengths, but will not be enforced at the governance level.   

Once the vote is settled with no disputes, the proposal is executed. Governance proposals for system updates and token minting require a 5% quorum and have to be won by 5% above the losing option. Disputes have no quorum requirement.  

For TIPs, once a proposal is submitted formally and a pull request is initiated on Github, the proposal then goes through the draft phase where the community can view the full written proposal and provide feedback.   

Proposals to the code case will go through development review, audit, 100% coverage for local tests, verification on Etherscan, and tested on a testnet before final review.   Then, the voting period involves a 7 day on-chain voting period where the community votes on the proposal.",True,,

A total of one billion QASH were created with 35% of the total supply (350 million QASH) sold through the token sale. Shareholders and management of QUOINE received 20% of tokens (200 million QASH) with no clear indication of vesting or lock-up periods. The remaining tokens went towards partners, with 30% of supply (300 million QASH) reserved for community and ecosystem incentivization and 15% of supply (150 million QASH) allocated to strategic partners and institutional buyers seen as long-term holders. While less than 1% of the total supply of QASH has been distributed to incentive allocations, the Quoine team maintains that all 65% of the total supply of QASH allocated to incentives will be distributed by year five of the protocol.

Quoine developed the current ERC20 token for funding purposes only and hopes to migrate these tokens to their own blockchain by Q2 2019. They plan to do this to comply with financial industry regulations at the base layer of their protocol i.e. incorporating KYC into their blockchain addresses. When this platform is released all one billion QASH will be exchanged to the new blockchain. Currently, the token supply is fixed and will be until the launch of this blockchain. Upon launch, however, new tokens will be minted through proof-of-stake. The team has not released details about future inflation rates or staking requirements.

It was necessary for Bounce to create a token because it promotes the network and allows users to support incentives on the protocol by deciding what tokens or coins pool creators can swap to. Also, tokeneconomics decisions such as the total supply and daily liquidity rewards are subject to change by the governance proposals. Users can interact with AUCTION by buying it on a centralized exchange such as Coinbase or but swapping Bitcoin, ETH, USDT, or BNB to AUCTION on other exchanges like Binance, Huobi Global, BKEX, Uniswap (V2), or Gati.io. Then, the token must be transferred to a wallet - Metamask, Binance Chain wallet, Coinbase wallet, etc. -  where it can be used for governance rights. Currently, Bounce supports Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain-based assets but it is quickly moving to support the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem.",Auctions,"AUCTION is solely used for platform activities and the governance of the protocol.

Use of the AUCTION governance allocation is initiated through on-chain proposals and voting. The governance vault has 9 signers - 6 of the 9 signers are needed to access any funds in the vault.  Governers stake AUCTION tokens in the transaction staking pool to get votes. Voting power is equal to the number of AUCTION tokens staked in the transaction fee staking pool. With at least 2% of the total votes (total number of staked tokens) a proposal can be made on the social trust board. All proposals are subject to a 3 to 7 days voting period - this is set by the proposer. Afterward, 60% of the daily rewards are allocated to governance participants, distributed according to each participants voting power compared to the total power. Additionally, 2% of the daily governance rewards are reserved for governors who create proposals, and 98% are shared amongst voters.",,,

A SPoS-based blockchain has a fixed sequence to release blocks. The mechanism ensures that blocks are built corresponding to a specific second within the minute, and minters would take turns to mint in this system. There is a preset quantity of active validators (supernodes) in the SPoS Network, in which supernodes form a market of minting pools with equal standing and minting output to ensure fairness in the economy of minting.   The cold minting feature in SPoS allows coin holders to lease their tokens to any supernode candidate and obtain coin rewards via block generation, while having full control over their own private keys. The SPoS algorithm also creates a network with no restriction on the movement of stake that prevents the system from busy contention attack.The cold minting feature in SPoS allows coin holders to lease their tokens to any supernode candidate and obtain coin rewards via block generation, while having full control over their own private keys. The SPoS algorithm also creates a network with no restriction on the movement of stake that prevents the system from busy contention attack.

The SPoS consensus model follows a <a href=""https://messari.io/resource/delegated-proof-of-stake"">Delegated Proof of Stake</a> model in which holders of VSYS coins lease coins to elected “supernodes,” which are responsible for the minting of new blocks. Traditional Proof of Stake systems elects new nodes to mine new blocks through a pseudo-random system based on the number of tokens the node has staked. In the SPoS consensus model, block minting is performed by Supernodes that are leased coins by VSYS network participants through minting.

UNFI is primarily a governance token that gives its holders the right to create community referendums as well as vote on community and core referendums.  Every UNFI belongs to one of four token classes, with each token class having different governance privileges and rights. Class 4 is the lowest-ranked class and has the least privileges. Conversely, Class 1 has the highest voting rights and privileges.   

Class 4 (Holder): Tokens are not eligible for proposing, voting and any other participation in the governance process. Its only feature is its transferability from one wallet to another.   

Class 3 (Waiting Period): As this class's name implies, tokens in this bucket are recently-staked tokens that must pass through a short period before their holders can begin to earn staking rewards on them. Similar to Class 4 tokens, they do not possess any governance privilege or right. Also, they must be downgraded to Class 4 before they can be transferred to other wallets.   

Class 2 (Upgraded): After passing through the waiting period, staked UNFI tokens become Class 2 tokens. These tokens are eligible to receive staking rewards as well as select governance rights like eligibility to vote for referendums and delegating to council representatives. However, holders of Class 2 tokens cannot propose referendums.   

Class 1 (Elite): Class 1 tokens have the most voting rights and rewards privileges, making the token class the most valuable in the Unifi ecosystem. Apart from the ability to propose and vote on referendums, Class 1 tokens earn staking rewards and additional community rewards from governance council representatives. To upgrade a token from Class 2 to Class 1, a staker/holder has to delegate their token to a council representative.   

Apart from its primary utility of governance, UNFI has additional utilities from yield farming to exclusive access and token arbitrage. UNFI holders can earn rewards on any Unifi-partnered blockchain of their choice. Also, as Unifi exists on multiple blockchains, there may be arbitrage opportunities that exist on different blockchains. UNFI and UP holders can take advantage of these opportunities in unique and creative ways as they arise.",Initial Exchange Offering,"The UNFI token was initially distributed through the Binance Launchpool. An allocation of 4% of the token's total supply was reserved for the Launchpool, resulting in 400,000 UNFI tokens available for mining on the platform. Participants were able to stake BUSD, BNB and ETH to farm UNFI tokens from the 14th of November 2020 through the 14th of December 2020. 280,000 UNFI was earmarked for the BNB staking pool, while 80,000 UNFI and 40,000 UNFI were allocated to the ETH and BUSD pools respectively. 1% of token supply was also used to finance Unifi's integration into the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem.

Alongside the start of the Launchpool mining, the entire ecosystem support allocation (10.5% of total supply) was fully unlocked to fund the expansion of the protocol to other blockchains. The other allocations, which include team tokens, private sale tokens, seed sale and liquidity provider pools, began their respective vesting schedules and all had a portion unlocked on the day of the initial distribution.","[{'title': 'Private Sale', 'start_date': '2020-11-14T00:00:00Z', 'type': None, 'details': None, 'end_date': '2020-11-14T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': 1200000, 'asset_collected': 'USD', 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.66, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 792000, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 792000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Seed Sale', 'start_date': None, 'type': None, 'details': None, 'end_date': None, 'native_tokens_allocated': 650000, 'asset_collected': 'USD', 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.15, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 97501, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 97500, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}]",,[],,[],10000000.0,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': 18.5, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': 15, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': None}",2020-11-12T00:00:00Z,2020-11-12T00:00:00Z,"A maximum of 100,000 UNFI tokens will be distributed monthly from the 5,100,000 tokens allocated to the liquidity provider pool. These tokens are distributed in the form of staking rewards to only Classes 1 & 2 token holders. Community council representatives also periodically earn rewards based on the class 1 tokens delegated to them.

While pool mining and ecosystem support token had no vesting, the rest of the supply allocations had the following vesting schedules:
Team: 3-year vesting schedule with 30% of allocation unlocked once a year
Private Sale: 10-month unlock schedule with 25% of allocation unlocked on the initial distribution date, and the same amount unlocked once every three months
Seed Sale: 12-month vesting with 25% unlocked at distribution date, and unlocks occurring every four months for the rest of the period",Fixed Supply,Fixed Supply,True,10000000.0,,,,,,,,,,"As Unifi is a multi-chain protocol, there is a need for a governance structure that cuts across the nuances of all participating blockchains to uphold universal governance policies. With this need in mind, the project team created a Global Governance Model (GGM) powered by the UNFI token. All Unifi-participating blockchains are duly represented in the GGM by a Council of Representatives. This way, every community that interacts with the Unifi ecosystem has a say in the governance of the protocol, ensuring everyone is carried along and progress is sustained equally across board.   

The GGM employs a delegate governance scheme that gives delegates, called Community Council Representatives, the sole ability to propose and vote on governance proposals. To incentivize other UNFI holders to delegate their voting rights, council representatives will periodically receive community rewards to be shared among their community members who have staked and delegated UNFI to them. This way, the communities are motivated to sustain the delegate scheme of the GGM, further driving progress to the viability of the Unifi protocol. There are two types of representatives in the Council of Representatives - Designated Council Representatives, and Community Council Representatives.   

Designated Council Representatives (DCR): The DCRs act on behalf of people who possess the most knowledge of the protocol, that is, the team and strategic partners. As such, the DCR slots are filled by some members of the Unifi team and strategic partners. The DCR's primary objective is to create opportunities for partnerships that are beneficial to the ecosystem. After each voting period, a DCR receives a governance reward from the Designated CR  rewards pool, with each DCR's disbursed reward varying according to the amount of value provided by the DCR.   

Community Council Representatives (CCR): The CCR serves as the voice of the Unifi community. Community members who want to act as a CCR need to be elected to the position, carried out through the delegation of Class 1 UNFI tokens. Elected CCRs who are identified by the community to have slacked on their duty of representation can be voted out and replaced by the community. CCRs typically receive two types of rewards: governance rewards and community rewards. The governance rewards are evenly split between all CCRs while the community rewards are meant for the UNFI holders who delegated their UNFI tokens to the CCRs. The community rewards are disbursed to the CCRs in proportion to the amount of Class 1 UNFI tokens delegated to them.   

At the inception of the Unifi DAO, the GGM will start with five designated council representatives and five community council representatives. After two voting periods (each voting period lasts for two weeks), one new council representative seat will be created in both the DCR and CCR. This seat expansion would continue until the 10-seat limit for DCR and 30-seat limit for CCR. This ensures the community has the most representation, and ultimately more authority, as the protocol matures.",Delegated On-Chain Vote,"Proposals and referendums are subject to on-chain voting to finalize the outcome of the governance process. Elected council representatives can create proposals to change certain parameters of the Unifi protocol. There is a fee that council representatives must pay to create proposals. This fee is governed by the GGM and is remitted to a Fee Account under the control of the GGM.   

Voting periods typically last for two weeks and new proposals created within a voting period can only be voted on during the next voting period. These proposals can only be voted for or against by the council representatives (both designated and community representatives) and require a majority vote of 50% + 1 to be successful. At the end of the voting period, a final count of votes is carried out on all proposals that were up for a vote during that period.",,,

Network Fees (Smart Contracts) – similar to other smart contract platforms, NXS is required when executing operations within a smart contract.
Network Fees (Hybrid Networks) – in the upcoming hybrid network feature, enterprises can operate on their private network for autonomy and privacy while using the public network for security and decentralisation aspects. Although transactions within the private network are free, there will be a fee charged for using hybrid network arrangements.

Cryptocurrency – NXS is the native currency of the Nexus ecosystem. NXS states that transactions are free and instantaneous (further developments are in the pipeline to cater to ecosystem growth and blockchain demand usage). NXS can also be staked starting at 0.5% reward per annum and building up to a maximum of 3% over one year.

Staking rewards - DG token will reward for staking
Airdrop rewards - DG token will be used for other projects’ airdrops
Payments for services and products
Through governance voting, DG token can be used in more scenarios

The exact details (such as DG cost per governance proposal) behind the DG tokens use are currently unclear prior to the DEX launch. As with most DEX's such as Uniswap unlike for Centralised Exchanges there is no tiered exchange fee discount available.
The promise that ""trades will be 100% free for the trader-maker, with no trading fee and gas fee"" is mentioned in the July update, which would rule out fee discounts.

Transaction fees are burned by the protocol to encourage liquidity. The teams decision to institute no supply cap is premised on the need to continually reward network maintainers (masternodes and stakers). 

Block rewards are set at a maximum of 5 PIVX tokens per block. Approximately 16% of each block reward is added to the PIVX treasury to fund further network development, which are paid monthly through ""superblocks"" as part of the community-governed budget. Instead of static or scheduled rewards, PIVX allows the network to decide how to reward the masternode and the staker. If too many masternodes join the network, rewards will increase for stakers.

There was no cap on the token sale, and all contributors received tokens proportional to the value of their contributions in BTC terms. 

Of the 433.5 million Dragon tokens created 238.4 million were distributed to the public. The Dragonchain team received 86.7 million DRGN which are subject to a two year vesting schedule, with supply released every month. The Dragonchain Foundation and Dragonchain Inc. each received 43.3 million tokens. 

Tokens allocated to the foundation will be used to support the open source codebase and support developers through programs and training. The remaining 21.7 million tokens were retained by the DragonFund incubator to distribute to participating projects.

The token can pair with all the other tokens listed on Ethereum and Avalanche. The governance token enables full control of the community over the development and future of the protocol. Pangolin's distribution is 100% community oriented. There is no allocation for investors, advisors or team. The project was founded by Ava Labs and were handed over to the developers participating in the Pangolin DAO to further develop and growth the protocol. PNG's supply is capped at 538 million. 95% of these tokens will be released via liquidity mining and 5% are set aside for community airdrops.  

The vesting schedule for the liquidity mining allocation is algorithmically defined. 256 million tokens will be distributed over the first four years, thereafter, the total emission is halved every four years.The airdrop portion will be distributed on the basis of ownership of UNI and SUSHI.

Airdrops are specifically allocated for existing UNI and SUSHI holders.

The Snapshot allows PNG holders to propose and submit ideas without writing code. It's free to vote and uses the PNG in your wallet for execution. It does not need any spending or transferring of the PNG tokens.  

Proposals submitted via Snapshot are non-binding. Its purpose is to implement a process to gauge community interest on a particular idea before the actual code is implemented for an onchain vote (binding).  

Unlike onchain proposals which are binary (Yes/No), proposals on Snapshot could have multiple options. However, proposals can only be submitted if you have PNG tokens in your wallet before.

These code based proposals will largely reflect the community intent captured via polls/discussions on Snapshot.  

Proposals can execute any smart contract call from Pangolin's Timelock contract. For a proposal to be submitted and validated, it must meet the following criterion: 

1. Codebase at the time of completion must be complete 
2. All choices are binary 
3. Proposer must have 1M PNG in their own wallet, or delegated by other holders to make the proposal 
4. Proposers have to keep the 1M PNG locked until the proposal fails or executed. If the balance falls below 1M, anyone can cancel the proposal. 
5. Addresses can have only one active proposal at a time.  

Here's how the basic process works: 
6. Proposal is submitted and 24 hours are given before actual voting starts to allow people to arrange for the necessary PNG needed to make votes. 
7. Proposal moves to active stage for three days to allow voting.  
8. Proposal either fails or passes on to the pending/queued status before its actually executed by the Timelock contract. 4. After 7-day waiting period proposals are implemented over the Pangolin protocol.

Participants purchasing over 2.5 ETH worth of RDN were required to fill out KYC documentation to gain whitelist access to the auction.

A uniform Dutch auction model was used for the token sale in an attempt to ensure fair distribution of tokens. In the auction, a fixed amount of 50 million RDN were guaranteed to be sold to buyers, regardless of the final strike price. Bidding commenced at an artificially high value and continued to depreciate until buyers accepted an equilibrium point they were willing to bid at. Prices continued to decline until all tokens were sold, at which point the auction terminated. All buyers received a uniform price equivalent to the most recent bid price, regardless of what they previously bit at earlier in the action.

At the launch of the network, 100 million RDN tokens were created. Token sale participants received 50% (50 million RDN) of total supply. The issuer, Brainbot Labs, retained 34% of tokens (34 million RDN) to compensate early developers and founders. The remaining 16% of supply (16 million RDN) was allocated to an external development fund.",,,,,,n/a,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,,

The ICO tokens were priced at $2 each for an initial distribution of 30M NAS (35M including investor sale). The token is based on the Ethereum platform and only ETH was accepted for the token sale. There were two bonus tiers associated with the sale, a 5% bonus for a 1000ETH contribution and a 10% bonus for a 3000ETH contribution. There was also a 5M NAS bonus program that served as an incentive to lock up the Ethereum based token in exchange for the Nebulas mainnet token which will be launching early 2018. The cap for this program was 5M tokens, with a reward of 100% for the lockup (an extra 5M tokens). The max supply of NAS is fixed at 100M.

Mining NAS has a fixed inflation rate of 4% of max supply, with 1% of the rewards going to the developer incentive program and 3% going to the bookkeepers. The developer incentive program is responsible for rewarding NAS to the developers who create popular and highly liquid applications, and the bookkeepers are essentially the miners of this network; responsible for verifying transactions and liquidity on the network.",,,,,,Other,,15.0,,n/a,,False,,,Upcoming,,False,,

Of the total supply of 999,449,964 IGNIS tokens to be available on the Ardor mainnet, 500 million tokens were available during the ICO. JLRDA tokens were used as non-tradable proofs of ownership during the sale, which were redeemed 1:1 for actual IGNIS tokens on 1 January 2018 when the Ardor platform’s mainnet went live. 

At the close of the crowd-sale, 261,194,254.50 JLRDA tokens had sold for a total of 167 million NXT (~ US$15 million). Jelurida kept 20% of these funds in NXT and sold the remaining 80% for Bitcoin and fiat currencies. The remaining 261,694,254.50 JLRDA from the crowd-sale were redeemed for the equivalent IGNIS by Jelurida and kept to fund future operations. As of 13 February 2019, Jelurida held 236,000,000.90 IGNIS.   

In addition to the crowd-sale, 499,449,964 IGNIS tokens were airdropped to Nxt account holders on a 0.5 IGNIS to 1 NXT ratio based on an account snapshot that occurred on 28 December 2017 at Nxt block height 1636363.

The Hegic protocol generates settlement fees every time a hedge contract is activated. HEGIC holders can activate a staking lot, giving them the right to collect staking rewards in the form of settlement fees. All settlement fees generated by the protocol are distributed equally to the active staking lot holders.

To activate a staking lot, a user is required to stake 888,000 HEGIC tokens with a lock-up period of 30 days. After this period, a token holder can request a withdraw with a required unlock period of 7 days.

Governance
HEGIC tokens are used as part of the Hegic Improvement Proposal (HIP) mechanism. HEGIC token holders can vote on key protocol parameters such as hedge contracts rates, settlement fee size, strike price multipliers, and assets supported by hedge contracts.

The token distribution is as follows:

20% (602,402,000 HEGIC) will be distributed among early contributors of the project through a monthly vesting period lasting 18 months.
10% (301,200,988 HEGIC) were allocated to the Hegic development fund. The funds are intended to fund and support the long-term development of the protocol funding developer and operation expenses
40% (1,204,809,000 HEGIC) will be distributed to liquidity providers and option holders through three liquidity mining and utilization rewards phases.
5% (150,596,900 HEGIC) were allocated to a Balancer pool to enable a secondary market for HEGIC tokens.
25% (753,001,000 HEGIC) were placed on a bonding curve that served as the main liquidity venue for the token during the first 4 weeks after the mainnet launch.

Liquidity mining and utilization rewards phases:

Phase I will last 12 months from September 9, 2020, to September 9, 2021. During the first phase, 481,800,000 tokens will be distributed pro-rata among liquidity providers. Option holder will receive 120,450,000 tokens.
The following 12 months will constitute the second phase of the program. Liquidity providers will receive 361,350,000 tokens, and options holders will receive 91,250,000.
The third and last phase will be from November 11, 2022, to November 11, 2023. During the last phase, option holders will receive a total of 29,200,00 tokens, while liquidity providers will get 120,450,000 tokens.",Fixed Supply,Fixed Supply,True,3012009888.0,,,,,,,,,,Hegic Improvement Proposals (HIPs) are intended to be the main governance mechanism to submit improvements to the protocol.

It has three primary use cases: 
Protocol governance 
Incentivize investor's for pooling assets with managers 
Incentivize managers to earn higher yeilds  

DHT token holders can collectively decide about charging an administration fee on the dHEDGE protocol. The fees is charged on the performance fees charged by managers running their respective pools on the protocol from their respective users. The performance fees is paid in pool tokens, hence successful managers will increase the share of their own pools moving forward in time. The admin fee is currently set at 10% of the performance fees.  

The fee along with other investments from the DAO are captured in a smart contract which represents a mega pool (pool of pools) called Uber Pool. (Learn more: https://medium.com/dhedge-org/dht-staking-uber-pool-10b361a2c22c). To participate in the Uber Pool, investors can stake DHT. The DHT stakers will be responsible for: 
Rebalancing the Uber Pool to ensure the best managers find place in the portfolio 
Make sure the Pool is growing    
DHT token holders can also participate in offchain voting on proposals affecting the protocol on dHEDGE's Snapshot page. (Link: https://gov.dhedge.org/#/dhedge/community).   

Rewards (like dividends) will be paid out quarterly from the Uber Pool (Protocol treasury). The quantity and mechanics of the distribution will be decided by voting vDHT holders. Current options for reward payments include sUSD, DHT and dTOP tokens.  

dHEDGE token holders can also stake their DHT's to earn rewards and participate in protocol governance. Rewards are calculated in vDHT and paid out on weekly and quarterly basis. The rewards are directly correlated to the amount of time tokens are locked in the contract. Higher time locked yields higher reward share than vice versa.   

DHT distributed through staking is released by increasing the token's circulation. Tokens distributed via the Uber Pool (Protocol treasury) is done by liquidating part of the protocol revenue earned via admin fee.","Auctions, Private Sale, Initial Exchange Offering","The dHEDGE community in september, 2020 decided, in an open vote, to distribute the first DHT tokens to the public via an auction process on Mesa — a platform on the Gnosis Protocol.  

These are the Key Details for the Mesa Auction: 
1) Maximum tokens sold: 5M DHT, 5% of total initial supply of DHT 
2) Bids are placed before the auction begins at 10am UTC Thursday September 17 
3) The auction will last for a maximum of 24 hours. 
4) Minimum bid price 25c and Minimum bid value ~$2,500  

The distribution of the DHT Token was as follows: 
1) Mesa Auction & Other Incentives-6.68% 
2) Seed-13.01% 
3) Strategic-5.44% 
4) Exchange Partner-3.75% 
5) Core Team-18.50% 
6) Advisors-1.50% 
7) Unallocated-51.12%

The protocol uses a quasi decentralized model to manage and govern the protocol. They have created dHEDGE EcoDAO as the governing body of the protocol. The EcoDAO's decision making authority will be vested to an elected council of 5-10 members that have emerged from the community. The dHEDGE EcoDAO will be responsible for the following: 
Protocol and community growth and administration 
Make proposals to dHEDGE DAO on growth and marketing efforts (Link: https://forum.dhedge.org/) 
Responsible for monthly reward distributions for sums below USDC 5k.   

The inaugural council includes the following:

1. DMP: dHEDGE meta proposals are aimed at making the governance self-correcting, DCPs have the following stages: a. Draft - Proposal made but not voted on b. Under-review: Vote on going c. Included: Passed vote d. Rejected: Failed vote e. Superseded: Proposal replaced by new proposal  

2. DFP: dHEDGE feature proposals. These feature proposals enable community to prioritize which features will be built first.  

3. DCP: dHEDGE capital proposals. These proposals reflect upon the capital and financial decisions taken by the community. Examples include rebalancing/distribution of protocol fees or capital allocations to EcoDAO.

Oxygen Protocol is powered by OXY, which is based on the Solana blockchain as an SPL token, and also available in ERC-20 format. OXY is a utility and governance token, and is designed to be used for both voting and capturing network revenue.

Governance
Each token is expected to represent one vote, and holders will be able to vote on governance initiatives. Protocol governance through OXY token holders is yet to be implemented.

Fee capture 
Revenue will include fees from trading, based on trading volume, asset management pools) liquidation fees, and network fees (the protocol is likely to charge a fraction of the yield earned by the lenders).

",Initial Exchange Offering,"Vesting

250M tokens are being released in the first year for community and ecosystem development, including pre-sales and auctions, exchange liquidity, and driving community growth.

The remaining tokens are locked for the first year from token genesis (December 24th,2020), and will then vest linearly over the following five years.","[{'title': 'IEO', 'start_date': '2021-03-11T00:00:00Z', 'type': None, 'details': 'OXY was sold via an Initial Exchange Offering on FTX, Ascendex, Gate on 11 March, 2021', 'end_date': '2021-03-12T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': 1, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.1, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 600000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}]",,[],,"[{'category': 'Community Fund', 'amount_in_percentage': 20}, {'category': 'Team', 'amount_in_percentage': 9}, {'category': 'Serum ecosystem Incentives', 'amount_in_percentage': 15}, {'category': 'Maps ecosystem incentives', 'amount_in_percentage': 10}, {'category': 'Product growth', 'amount_in_percentage': 25}, {'category': 'Private Sale', 'amount_in_percentage': 10}, {'category': 'IEO', 'amount_in_percentage': 2}, {'category': 'Partners', 'amount_in_percentage': 8}]",10000000000.0,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': None, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': None, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': None}",,,,,,True,10000000000.0,,,,,,,,,,"Oxygen has proposed a token-weighted governance model where 1 OXY = 1 vote.

Holders can vote on adjusting protocol parameters, introducing new pairs, integrating new protocols, or allocating treasury funds. Additionally, SLICE is used to further promote the liquidity and solvency of the tranches on the protocol. This is achieved by incentivizing users through staking and distributions.

Three staking modules have been introduced - SLICE staking, SLICE-ETH LP staking and SLICE-DAI LP staking. On the staking platform, users can lock-up their tokens and receive SLICE rewards from the Tranche Treasury. 

Besides staking, users are incentivized to deposit into specific tranches by distributing SLICE to token holders across markets. The deposits are based on market conditions and tranche activity through a mechanism called Solvency Incentive Ratio. This way, certain tranches can be promoted over other tranches to ensure the protocol remains solvent. The distributions are funded by the Treasury.","Airdrop, Token Swap, Private Sale","In 2017, Jibrel set out to build structured finance and asset tokenization products on the Ethereum network within a regulated setting. To fund project development, Jibrel created the Jibrel Network Token (JNT) with a total supply of 200,000,000 tokens and sold 60% of the supply in its ICO in 2017. The remainder was allocated among advisors and partners, the team, bounties, and the pre-ICO. Given the regulatory nature of the project, JNT was structured as a centralized token in order to comply with laws and regulation.

In 2017, the company raised 37 million USD through the sale of its Jibrel Network Token (JNT). A total of 160,000,000 JNT were distributed. Switching focus on Tranche Finance, the JNT token was replaced by the SLICE token in 2021.

As part of the transition, SLICE was airdropped to all JNT holders at a ratio of 10:1. As such, a total of 20,000,000 SLICE were distributed to the community, the treasury, and the team. The airdrop was held on February 28, 2021. The initial distribution was as follows:
Community: 14,000,000 SLICE (70% of total supply)
Treasury: 3,000,000 SLICE (15% of total supply)
Team: 3,000,000 SLICE (15% of total supply)

The Tranche Treasury will be distributed to the users over time through staking and distributions. Finally, the team tokens will be unlocked on a vesting schedule of 5 years with a 2 year cliff.","[{'title': 'Jibrel Network Token Private Sale', 'start_date': '2017-07-25T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private Sale', 'details': 'The company raised its first 3 million USD through a private sale to investors.

MYST is used for bandwidth usage payments to VPN node operators. VPN customers can make payments using various cryptocurrencies and fiat currency, however it will be converted automatically to MYST.  

At time of writing, MYST is purely used for payments, hence it does not confer voting rights to token holders. Governance will be introduced in a future tokeneconomics change.  MYST is available on the Ethereum, Polygon, and BNB Chain networks. It can be obtained on Bittrex Global, HitBTC, as well as Uniswap V3 (Ethereum), QuickSwap (Polygon), and PancakeSwap (BNB Chain).  

Token Upgrade:

MYST was launched as a standard ERC-20 token on May 30, 2017. On August 31, 2020, it was upgraded to an ERC-20 token with 'permit' (ERC-2612) and EIP-712 support.  Holders of the legacy token are able to migrate their tokens 1:1 at any time with no time limit. Token supply figures remain unchanged despite the token migration.

Tokeneconomics Change:

A new tokeneconomics model, Tokenomics 2.0 is expected to be launched in H2 2022, introducing staking and delegation pools for rewards. The DAI stablecoin will be added as an additional payment method, however VPN node operators will receive their payments solely in DAI, instead of MYST. 

VPN node operators will be required to stake MYST to be able to provide services. The maximum daily amount of DAI a node operator can earn will be proportional to the amount of MYST staked. Node operators will also be able to rent MYST tokens from the delegation pool for a fee, hence increasing their MYST stake and daily DAI earnings limit.

Inflation and Token Rewards:

At present, VPN node operators receive MYST as payment for providing VPN services to customers. The largest portion of tokens is paid to the VPN node owners, while the remainder goes towards protocol development and support. Tokens originate from MYST's fixed supply and no new tokens are minted.  Staking and delegation pools are expected to be introduced with a future tokeneconomics change.

Buyback or Burn:

No buybacks are planned. Legacy MYST tokens are burned as holders migrate to the upgraded MYST token. Token supply numbers remain unchanged due to the 1:1 migration ratio.",,"Two sales rounds were organized:
Public seed round on December 16, 2016 raising 6,000 ETH
Public crowdsale on May 30, 2017 raising 14 million Swiss francs. The United States was excluded.

MYST tokens were distributed after the crowdsale's completion on May 30, 2017, with trading allowed from June 13, 2017.

Seed round participants received five times the tokens compared to what crowdsale participants received for a similar contribution amount. 20% of seed round tokens were distributed at token creation, with the remainder locked up for 12 months.","[{'title': 'Seed Round', 'start_date': '2016-12-16T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Public', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2016-12-17T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': 'ETH', 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': None, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 6000, 'amount_collected_in_usd': None, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Crowdsale', 'start_date': '2017-05-30T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Public', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2017-05-30T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': 'CHF', 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': None, 'amount_collected_in_asset': 14000000, 'amount_collected_in_usd': None, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': ['United States']}]","[{'name': 'Seed Round Summary', 'link': 'https://medium.com/mysterium-network/how-to-participate-in-mysterium-network-presale-2f5c17094099'}, {'name': 'Crowdsale - Framework Agreement', 'link': 'https://www.bitcoinsuisse.com/assets/pdf/FrameworkAgreement_Mysterium.pdf'}]",[],[],"[{'category': 'Core Development', 'amount_in_percentage': 40}, {'category': 'Operational', 'amount_in_percentage': 25}, {'category': 'Marketing and Sales', 'amount_in_percentage': 25}, {'category': 'Legal and Compliance', 'amount_in_percentage': 10}]",32433365.0,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': None, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': None, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': None}",2017-05-30T00:00:00Z,2017-05-30T00:00:00Z,"A fixed supply of 32,433,365 MYST tokens were created and distributed based on the following allocation:

Token Creation Contributors (Crowdsale)

Token creation was determined based on a soft cap of 6 million CHF, and a hard cap of 14 million CHF. MYST was created according to the following ratios:
1 CHF = 1.2 MYST before soft cap is reached
1 CHF = 1 MYST after soft cap is reached; limited by hard cap

Foundation, Bounty, Advisors
9% of all tokens to Mysterium Foundation's multi-sig wallet

Seed Participants

Seed participants were rewarded multiples of MYST tokens compared to crowdsale participants for a similar investment amount. The multiplier ratio was determined based on an ETH/CHF ratio calculated at the beginning of token creation. 6,000 ETH was collected during the seed round.

Multiplier ratios:
1x if 2 million or less CHF is collected
1x-5x gradually increasing for a 2-6 million CHF collection
5x fixed if more than 6 million CHF is collected

Second Phase (Future Funding)

The amount of MYST tokens reserved were based on the following:
50% of all tokens if up to 2 million CHF was collected
Gradual decrease to 15% between 2-6 million CHF collected
15% fixed for a collection of 6 million CHF and above

Founders
10% of all tokens are allocated

Vesting: 80% of seed participant tokens, as well as all second phase and founder tokens were locked up for a period of 12 months following token creation on May 30, 2017.

In return for performing these functions, governors that stake Meta tokens will earn staking rewards.","Centralized Distribution, Airdrop, Crowdsale, Private Sale","In July 2020 the mStable team issued 100m MTA. The allocations were as follows:

Investors and Partnerships - 20,183,300 (20.2%)
Team & Advisors - 15,464,000 (15.5%)
Institutional Liquidity Mining - 6,724,200 (6.7%)
Future Contributors Reserve - 3,462,500 (3.5%)
Mesa Auction and Balancer Pool Seeding - 3,166,000 (3.2%)
Public Rewards and Staking Reserve - 51,000,000 (51.0%)

The initial MTA Genesis sale was run on the Mesa platform, built by Gnosis. The auction was performed by the mStable DAO. 2.66m MTA were sold for approximately 4.7m mUSD.

Originally, the MTA Gensis was planned to take place on Balancer in the form of a initial liquidity pool seeding in a similar style to UMA's Uniswap listing. This approach was revised due to concerns about front running resulting in an unfair distribution of MTA tokens for our community, and a new pubic genesis event was decided on - an open auction to provide initial price discovery, and a subsequent Balancer pool seeding to create liquidity.","[{'title': 'Friends and Family', 'start_date': '2019-01-01T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2019-01-31T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.25, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 60000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Angel', 'start_date': '2019-06-01T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2019-10-01T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.05, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 325000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Seed', 'start_date': '2020-05-01T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2020-06-01T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.15, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 1000000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Strategic Investments', 'start_date': '2020-06-01T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2020-07-01T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.15, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 168500, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Liquidity Partner', 'start_date': '2020-07-01T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Private', 'details': None, 'end_date': '2020-07-01T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 0.2, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 250000, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}, {'title': 'Mesa Auction', 'start_date': '2020-07-18T00:00:00Z', 'type': 'Public', 'details': 'Initial DEX offering', 'end_date': '2020-07-18T00:00:00Z', 'native_tokens_allocated': None, 'asset_collected': None, 'price_per_token_in_asset': None, 'equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd': 1.7, 'amount_collected_in_asset': None, 'amount_collected_in_usd': 4728869, 'is_kyc_required': None, 'restricted_jurisdictions': None}]",,[],,[],100000000.0,"{'allocated_to_investors_percentage': 20, 'allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage': 16, 'allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage': None}",2020-07-18T00:00:00Z,,"The majority of Meta tokens will be emitted to the community via public rewards and staking.
