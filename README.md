# Messing with Messari API

1. In your environment run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` and install the dependencies.
2. run `api_dataset.ipynb` from top to bottom.
3. Check csv output (`assets.csv`). Otherwise you can view the table in plaintext too (`table.txt`). Make sure you use a viewer that doesn't wrap .txt files; VS Code is fine.
